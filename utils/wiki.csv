01-MTF,Bot,"[[Image]]MTF Vault.png|Running into MTF in a [[Storage]] vault[[/Image]]A friendly bot that rarely shows up in [[Storage]] in an already opened vault. Will join you as an uncontrollable purple ally for the duration of the map and uses [[01-MTF's Autohacker]] to automatically open any other vaults it can see. It will assimilate or destroy most enemies it encounters extremely quickly with its high spectrum high damage EM gun [[01-MTF's Shockpuncher]].It disappears after leaving the map, so applying positive salvage with something like a [[Plasma Cutter]] and destroying this bot before leaving the floor is highly recommended to get some very good loot early in the game. The Shockpuncher in particular is a very powerful weapon that is strong throughout the majority of the game as long as you can deal with its short range."

Caves,Location,"Caves is the most frequent [[Branch]] map throughout all of [[Factory]] depths. It is a non-[[0b10]]-controlled map where [[Derelict|Derelicts]] often roam free and hostile 0b10 squads patrol and can be taken out without fear of reinforcements. Non-patrolling 0b10 outposts guarded by a [[Sentry]] and dormant bots are common. Every depth has 2 guaranteed Caves exits and each Caves map is a part of a series of 3 maps in a row. Not counting event-based exits, all first Caves maps of each depth can only be exited by entering the second Caves map. Caves maps do not have very many regular parts on the ground, but piles of [[Scrap]] contain usable but partially damaged parts and [[Derelict Log|Derelict Logs]] can give unique intel about upcoming floors.
There are different names for the different types of Caves maps and they have slightly different characteristics. Lower Caves is the name given to the first 2 Caves maps on -7 and -6, while Caves maps on -5 and -4 are named Upper Caves. The third caves map is accessible only by exiting the depth-specific special branch at the left side of the second caves map and is called Proximity Caves, regardless of depth. Lower and Upper Caves are very similar in all but [[Robot Tier]], but Proximity Caves tends to be more densely populated with patrols.
Caves are patrolled fairly lightly by hostile 0b10 bots compared to the main floors. [[Infowar]] utilities are a good option to avoid unnecessary encounters as many patrols can be avoided with a bit of patience. Caves have a unique mechanic where parts dropped from 0b10 bots will automatically self-destruct after a few turns. Looting must be done quickly or else the dropped parts will be lost forever. The only 2 ways around this mechanic are [[Self-destruct Interrupter|Self-destruct Interrupters]] and [[Electromagnetic Weapons]]. The interrupters will prevent the parts from frying while active and EM damage will interfere with the self-destruct mechanism. While EM will give [[Corrupted Parts]], it is far better to end up with corrupted parts than to end up with no parts at all.
Due to the low rate of good parts spawning on the floor and the overall difficulty in looting hostile 0b10 bots, it is very easy for an unprepared build to fall apart in these maps. Bringing plenty of spares into Caves is highly recommended to avoid running out of essentials like propulsion, weapons, and armor. [[Launcher|Launchers]] are a must here to handle ambushes of large numbers of 0b10 bots hiding in outposts. Launchers are also incredibly useful when entering a Caves map because the standard spawn protection that is present in 0b10 maps doesn't apply here. That means that one (or more) patrols can appear right in Cogmind's face on entering a map.
[[Header:2]]Lore[[/Header]]
[[Lore]]0b10 Records|Caves[[/Lore]]
[[Header]]Navigation[[/Header]]
Cave maps all have a very similar overall layout. While the paths within the caves are unpredictable, these maps can typically be divided into 6 equal chunks. Top left, top middle, top right, bottom left, bottom middle, and bottom right. Cogmind will always spawn from the top right or bottom right chunks in Lower and Upper Caves or the top left or bottom left chunks in Proximity caves. One exit will always be in the chunk furthest from Cogmind. In the second Lower or Upper Caves map, the unique branch exit will be in that furthest chunk and the exit back to the main floor will always be on the same side. A good rule of thumb is that left is away from 0b10 while right is toward 0b10.

Caves has one of the largest collections of prefabs of all the maps in the game There is a wide mix of good and bad prefabs. One of the strongest prefabs, the Tinkerer with a [[Core Expander]], is so strong that it alone can be a good reason to go into Caves. The most common encounters on this map tend to be the many different forms of 0b10 outposts. [[Transmission Jammer|Transmission Jammers]] are highly recommended to take bots in these outposts out one at a time without getting overwhelmed. In some hostile encounters, [[Sentry|Sentries]] can call for a reinforcement [[Assault Squad]]. In the first Caves map each depth only no reinforcements will come as there is no 0b10-controlled exit. Killing the Sentries as quickly as possible is highly recommended in all other cases. Fighting these outposts is a bad idea for an unprepared build, but larger outposts with Terminal intel are very vaulable. This intel can be the same as the intel found in [[Derelict Log|Derelict Logs]].
Friendly Derelicts will not move from their guard position, but they will engage any 0b10 forces they see. Leading hostile squads into them can let them do the fighting for you. This is particularly easy to do for fast airborne builds who don't want to engage in combat and can use the Derelicts as a distraction. These Derelicts can also be safely salvaged for parts and will not retaliate.

Exiles,Location,"The Exiles map appears as a branch off of [[Mines]] on either -10 or -9 and is home to the Exiles, a group of friendly Derelict Tinkerer outcasts made up of [[EX-BIN]], [[EX-DEC]], [[EX-HEX]], and their bodyguard [[8R-AWN]]. These Exiles have a large collection of unique prototype parts that are only available in the Exiles vault. The entrance is guarded by some rigged engines that blow up when a hostile bot crosses them. There are some lore terminals with entries written by each of the tinkerers that describe many of the prototype parts obtainable on this map as well as some that are not. The terminal near the center of the map also contains a log entry that points to the depth that [[Zion]] is on. Various caches of storage units and energy/matter storage can be found throughout the map. ""The Gauntlet"" at the bottom of the map is a stretch of tester bots that are working on the latest batch of prototype parts. These Derelicts have names that reference Cogmind community members. This map is also home to the [[Farcom]] machine and a unique alignment.
Carrying a [[Datajack]] into this map is recommended due to all of the prototype parts that the Exiles and 8R-AWN have on them. Parsing them will provide the associated prototype part IDs so you can recognize the parts later.
Be wary of [[Corruption]] on this map. There is no way to cleanse corruption and misfires become possible at 1% corruption. One misfire hitting the wrong thing will result in the whole map turning aggressive and death will likely follow. Unequipping all ranged weapons is recommended if Cogmind has any corruption.
[[Header]]Alignment[[/Header]]
Using the Farcom machine grants an 18-radius permanent combat bot sensor in any [[0b10]] controlled maps and one of the special vault items. If Farcom abilities are retained it is impossible to [[Imprint]] in the same run and entering any research branches will have massive consequences. [[Spoiler:Spoiler]]On entering maps like [[Testing]] and [[Quarantine]], [[Maximum Security]] will be triggered.[[/Spoiler]] If those branches can be avoided, Farcom can provide some great advantages to help players with permanent itemless sensor abilities.
3 random items will be present in the vault in most games. Here is the list of Exiles specific vault items that can be obtained with Farcom:[[List]][[0b10 Alert Chip]]|[[Army-in-a-Box]]|[[AWS/Autocannon]]|[[AWS/Gauss]]|[[AWS/Thermal]]|[[Chronowheel]]|[[Cloak of Protection]]|3 [[Deploy-a-Sentry]]|[[Field Lobotomy Kit]]|[[Firepult]]|[[Flying Fortress v7]]|[[Gui.

[[Header:2]]Alignment Options[[/Header]]
There are more ways to interact with Farcom without just taking a single vault item. Here are all of the outcomes:[[List]]Use Farcom machine, take 0-1 vault items: Permanently gain Farcom and the use of the vault item taken.|Use Farcom machine, take 2-3 vault items: Gain Farcom until [[Factory]] is reached. After that, the Exiles notice that you are a thief and will remove Farcom. [[Master Thief|Master Thieves]] will sometimes ambush you at the entrance/exits in [[Caves]] maps and rip parts off of your body and from your inventory. They will prioritize high rating parts and Exiles prototypes.|Use Farcom machine (or don't), attack Exiles and leave the map with 0 vault items: Lose Farcom instantly. The Exiles will become aggressive and send [[Assembled (4)|Assembled]], a [[DAS Turret]], and [[8R-AWN]] to kill you. After leaving the map, there is a chance that a hostile [[Z-Hero]] will spawn and attack you. Note: Using vault items on the map is safe as long as no items actually leave the map.|Use Farcom machine, attack Exiles and leave the map with 1 or more vault items: The same as above except you get Master Thieves in caves as described above.[[/List]]
[[Header]]Variations[[/Header]]
There are several variations of the Exiles map that can change things dramatically. In the majority of maps, the Exiles are present. However, there are 2 possible variations in the maps:
[[Image]]Exiles Attacked.png|Attacked Exiles vault[[/Image]][[List]]Abandoned Exiles: In this map, the Exiles have all fled the map and taken nearly everything on the map as well. Neither Farcom nor any vault items are obtainable in this seed. However, EX-DEC may be found in [[Spoiler:Spoiler]][[Warlord (Location)|Warlord]] in the Vortex Lab[[/Spoiler]] in these seeds.|Attacked Exiles: In this map, the Exiles have been attacked and are missing. There are disabled and rewirable bots on the map and random parts on the ground. Farcom is not obtainable on this seed, but one random vault prototype is available by using the manual code [[Spoiler:Spoiler]]\\1234[[/Spoiler]] on the vault terminal.|While not changing the map in any way, there is a chance that a large [[0b10]] attack force will assault the Exiles base after using the Farcom machine and exiting the vault.[[/List]]
[[Header]]Fighting[[/Header]]
Fighting the Exiles is a challenging yet rewarding endeavor. Although they are normally friendly, they can pack quite a punch and will likely end the run of any unprepared player. As far as rewards go, [[8R-AWN]] has some powerful unique [[8R-AWN's Boregun|Boreguns]] with a high salvage and destroy critical %, out-of-depth parts including [[Exp. Heat Sink]], [[Adv. Weapon Cycler]], [[Exp. Targeting Computer]], and [[Adv. Myomer Leg]]. Another unique part, the [[AS-neutralizer No. 17b]] is very helpful in a later game branch [[Zion Deep Caves]]. Other useful parts on some of the Exiles themselves are [[Adv. Component Analysis Suite]], [[System Purifier]], [[Cmb. Antigrav System]], [[Imp. Armor Integrity Analyzer]], [[Exp. Core Analyzer]], and [[Adv. Transmission Jammer]].
[[Image]]Exiles Kill Build.png|Example Exiles kill build[[/Image]]
Fighting the Exiles is not recommended on -10 due to lower slot count, lower core integrity, and difficulty in getting enough integrity to survive the 8R-AWN fight. If fighting on -9, evolving a 3rd weapon slot can be very effective in killing 8R-AWN and any potential [[Z-Hero|Z-Heroes]] that might spawn in the next Mines map. The third weapon slot is not required to kill by any means, however, and any combination of weapon, utility, and propulsion slots for the evolve will work. As a basic checklist, the following parts are recommended:[[List]]Multiple kinetic guns with backups, ideally [[Hvy. Assault Rifle|Hvy. Assault Rifles]] or [[Imp. Assault Rifle|Imp. Assault Rifles]], weapons with negative salvage like [[Shotgun]] or a ballistic cannon like [[Imp. Light Cannon]] can work but 8R-AWN has very strong loot that is nice to get if possible|Multiple pieces of armor, preferably [[Hrd. Light Armor Plating]] or [[Med. Armor Plating]]|Multiple [[Lgt. Treads]] or [[Imp. Treads]] with backups|At least one launcher like [[Grenade Launcher]], [[Mni. Grenade Launcher]], or [[Rocket Launcher]]|(Optional) A way to gain positive salvage like a [[Plasma Cutter]] or [[Salvage Targeting Computer]], in a pinch ramming 8R-AWN can provide a bit of salvage (+3 per ram)|(Optional) [[Blade Trap|Blade Traps]] for 8R-AWN or [[Explosive Trap|Explosive Traps]] for the Assembled, if an early trap extractor or trap stockpile are found in Mines[[/List]]
[[Image]]Exiles Kill.png|A visual guide to killing the Exiles[[/Image]]
There are some things that should be done before actually doing the fight itself. The image on the right serves as a visual reference. Any rigged engines used must be in inventory before aggroing the Exiles, otherwise the engines will still remain loyal to the Exiles and explode only on Cogmind. Traps should also be set before any hostilities begin. Blade Traps should be placed along the north edge of the wall after 8R-AWN to ensure that they are triggered and Explosive Traps should be placed next to the [[Assembled (4)|Assembled]] to hit them while they are grouped up together. Matter pods should be relocated near the 8R-AWN fighting spot (See point #4 in diagram) to avoid running out of matter in combat. Any allies should be told to stay in the same general area so they can contribute to the fight. However, Grunts can't deal much damage until [[8R-AWN's Armor/TH]] is destroyed. Finally, some vault items may come in handy for the fight. The [[Cloak of Protection]]'s effect is not so strong, but when turned off it is a high coverage high integrity piece of armor. The [[Longsword +1]] is a very effective kill tool. The [[Potential Leg|Potential Legs]] have a lot of integrity in case you run out of propulsion during the fight. The [[Gui. Plasma Cannon]] may be used to safely destroy the [[DAS Turret]] without getting attacked back. One thing to consider about the vault is that there may be a 0b10 attack on the Exiles after exiting. In those cases, an Exiles kill may either have to be cancelled or at least turned into a 8R-AWN only kill. Aside from that, the fight may begin:
[[Image]]Exiles Launcher DAS.png|Launchering the DAS turret[[/Image]]
[[List:Ordered]]Shoot one of the spike-shaped machines to turn the Exiles hostile.|Drop the rigged engines from the entrance every few tiles while walking toward the spot for step #3, they have an explosion radius of 2. This will take care of most of the Assembled that are coming your way. IMPORTANT: This must be done after the Exiles become hostile. If you do it before that, they will explode on Cogmind.|Pull out a Launcher and dispose of the remaining Assembled.|Go to the corner to fight 8R-AWN. This is the part that needs the most backups, as 8R-AWN will destroy many of your parts very quickly due to high damage and high part destroy critical chance. Always put on backup parts right away after they are destroyed. Make sure to apply salvage with a Plasma Cutter if you have it before finishing the kill. You may run out of matter and have to refill from matter pods at this point, which is why preemptively moving the matter pods here can be very important. Many kill attempts that don't have enough damage or integrity will end here.|Hopefully you have some good loot after 8R-AWN is destroyed. [[8R-AWN's Boregun|Boreguns]] are a very easy way to destroy the [[DAS Turret]]. Penetrate through the machines to try and kill the turret without getting shot at because the cannon deals incredibly high damage. If no Boreguns were dropped, using a launcher is another good option. The idea is to aim around the spike in the machine so that you can't get hit but the explosion radius will still hit the turret.|Finally, all that is left is to loot the Exiles and their Derelict friends. Apply positive salvage to the Exiles with a Plasma Cutter if possible. Otherwise just finish them off with whatever you have left. Watch out for [[EX-DEC]] as they have a deadly [[AWS/EX-DEC]] that can deal a lot of damage very quickly if you aren't careful. It has a short range, so just take them out from a distance.[[/List]]"

Factory,Location,"Factory is the beginning of the midgame in Cogmind and is where the game really starts to open up. In stark contrast with earlier [[Materials]] maps, Factory start out huge with a ~200x200 tile map size. The rooms, the corridors, and the overall layout are all much wider and more open and connected than Materials. The patrols and guards are more spread out and stealth play with airborne propulsion and [[Infowar]] becomes a strong gameplay option.
[[Alert]] starts to be more of a concern as the maps become bigger and harder to traverse. [[Hackware]] is useful to be able to successfully use Access hacks at terminals to locate exits. [[Signal Interpreter|Signal Interpreters]] will also be more useful at identifying exits as the exit types will be less predictable. [[Caves]] exits are available in every Factory map. They can be difficult if a player is unprepared, but they can provide many unique rewards and will typically result in a complete Alert purge by the time Cogmind makes it back to the next main floor.
As [[Extermination Squads]] become a regular occurrence, a large part of a build's effectiveness becomes how quickly Cogmind can kill Programmers. [[Corruption]] can build up very quickly if fighting multiple Programmers in open areas without a good way to kill them. Having strong thermal or kinetic weaponry is a good way to destroy them quickly. For lighter airborne builds, non-Impact melee weapons can work, although using Hackware to recall Exterminations is also very effective. This tends to be more important in later depths as Exterminations will upgrade from a single [[P-60 Hacker]] to 1-2 [[P-70 Sage]] per squad.
There are many new mechanics introduced beginning in Factory floors:
[[List]][[A-02 Transporter|Haulers]] begin to summon reinforcements when attacked if they contain [[Prototype Parts]]|[[Extermination Squad|Exterminations]] begin to appear regularly|[[Fabricator|Fabricators]] can show up on the map|[[B-75 Beast|Behemoths]] can show up on the maps|[[Cargo Convoy|Cargo Convoys]] can travel through the map|[[Chute Trap|Chute Traps]] can appear that will drop Cogmind into [[Wastes]]|[[DSF]] terminals will start to appear that can take you to DSF maps[[/List]]

[[Header:2]]Exits[[/Header]]
There are 4 types of main exits on Factory floors:
[[List]]Main access exits: These always need to the next main floor, either Factory or [[Research]]. Sometimes these exits can be identifiable by a 5-tile wide corridor leading to a dead-end with the exit in the middle. All other types of exits that aren't a part of a prefab can be either a main or branch exit. There will always be 4 of these exits per Factory map.|[[Caves]] exit: These exits can never be identified purely by looks. Using a [[Signal Interpreter]] or access hack to identify exits are the main ways to do so. There will always be 2 of these exits per Factory map.|[[Spoiler:Spoiler]][[Extension]] exit: Extension can always be identified by a distinctive prefab where a large area is sealed off by orange Blast Doors. These doors can be open or locked. If locked, the nearby [[Terminal]] will have an Open hack available to open the doors. Otherwise, shooting the walls open with strong thermal weaponry, causing an engine detonation with an EM launcher, or strong melee attacks can dig through or around these doors. Factory maps at the same depth as Extension will have 2 Extension exits.[[/Spoiler]]|[[Spoiler:Spoiler]][[Armory]] exit: Armory can always be identified in Factory by a large 5 tile corridor leading into a 3-tile doorway. These exits will always be heavily guarded by a mix of [[Y-72 Warden|Sentries]] and [[G-67 Veteran|Grunts]] and have large stockpiles of weapons nearby. Factory maps at the same depth as Armory will have 1 of these types of exit.[[/Spoiler]][[/List]]
[[Image]]Factory DSF Exit.png|Hacked open DSF exit[[/Image]]
Several non-standard exits also begin to appear in Factory. [[Chute Trap|Chute Traps]] will throw Cogmind into [[Wastes]] which can end many good runs if unprepared. Using a [[Datajack]] on a [[K-01 Serf|Serf]] for the find_chute hack is very effective to either reveal traps to avoid or areas to head toward if planning to take on the [[C-40 Crusher|Crushers]] in combat. The other type of exit is a [[DSF]]. These exits can be hacked open at distinctive DSF terminals but will automatically lock upon being spotted by any hostile. Stealth or good luck is required to make it to these exits."

Materials,Location,"Materials is the first real level of the game. These maps are small, cramped and have few paths forward. This is the first map with hostile [[0b10]] patrols hanging around, comprised mainly of low level [[G-34 Mercenary]] and [[G-47 Trooper]] grunts and [[S-10 Pest]] swarmers. There are also a few special special mechanics such as [[U-05 Engineer|Engineers]] not calling for reinforcements when attacked while trying to build structures in -10 and -9 and [[A-02 Transporter|Haulers]] not calling for reinforcements at all.
Trying to play flight or hover is not easy in Materials due to many forced encounters with combat robots, little room for maneuvering and few slots yet available for good utilities. The usual recommended way to play these maps is to grab some legs or treads and start blasting. Most players prefer not to transfer to airborne propulsion until [[Factory]] where it is much easier to stealth around and avoid combat. In Materials, it's good to fight enemies one at a time by leading them to one of the many doorways around the map. Use of launchers is very effective whenever there is more than a single bot grouped up close.
[[Alert]] is not a big issue in these maps because of the relatively small map size and number of total patrols. If making a mess of the floors on -10 and -9, entering the [[Mines]] is a good way to lose all of the alert gained from the early Materials maps.
Full list of depth-specific mechanics that apply in Materials:

Storage Unit|Small]], [[Med. Storage Unit|Medium]], and [[Lrg. Storage Unit|Large]] storage units[[/Images]]The storage cache prefab can be very important early on in the game. Cogmind only starts with a [[Sml. Storage Unit]] with very little room for important backup parts and should upgrade ASAP. While not guaranteed, these storage caches will appear on almost every Materials map. [[Hcp. Storage Unit]] and [[Huge Storage Unit]] can both be commonly found on the floor in these maps, but they are not included in the standard storage cache prefab.
The other important cache is the out-of-depth parts cache. These caches contain 3 groups of 4 parts that will be one rating out of depth and can include prototypes. For example, on -9 Materials the standard highest rating part is a 2, while the cache will contain rating 3 or 3* [[Prototype Parts]]. This is one of the best ways to become very strong in Materials. For example, getting a stockpile of [[Enh. Autogun|Enh. Autoguns]] on -9 can help set a combat up for multiple floors to come.[[Header:2]]Exits[[/Header]]There are 3 types of normal exits in Materials:[[List]]Main access exits: These always lead to the next main floor, either Materials or [[Factory]]. These exits can be recognized by their distinctive 3-tile corridor leading to a dead-end exit along the edges of the map. There are always 3 of these per Materials map.|[[Mines]] exits: These exits are almost always distinguishable by a few specific prefabs of some machinery and a cache of items. Occasionally Mines exits will spawn without the prefab and look like standard exits. There are either 1 or 2 Mines exits on -10 and -9.|[[Storage]] exits: These exits do not have a prefab at all and look like standard exits. There is often a [[Y-45 Defender|Sentry]] guarding these exits, but it is not guaranteed. Storage only spawns on 1 depth between -9 and -7 and 1-2 exits can be found to Storage on that map.[[/List]][[Header]]Events[[/Header]][[Spoiler:Spoiler]][[Image]]8R-AWN in Materials.png|8R-AWN passing through Materials[[/Image]]Rarely, [[8R-AWN]] can appear in Materials, passing through to the nearest Mines exit.

Mines,Location,"Mines is the first [[Branch]] of the game and is guaranteed to appear on -10 and -9 of [[Materials]] in every game. These maps have several unique early-game rewards that can pay off throughout the whole run, but also has some very dangerous events. The assembled infestation event is a common cause of early death in runs. Aside from the events, the map is sparsely populated with early game patrols of [[G-34 Mercenary]] and [[G-47 Trooper]] grunts and [[S-10 Pest]] swarmers. Several types of friendly and occasionally hostile Derelicts can also be found here. [[Derelict Log|Derelict Logs]] and [[Scrap]] can be found randomly on the ground.

The 3 different types of Derelict shop events are all great events to get. The out-of-depth parts will usually provide an immediate buff and the early [[Imp. Trap Extractor]] can be very strong for anybody who wants to use a lot of [[Trap|Traps]]. The drone bay shop gives one of the following unique parts that aren't accessible anywhere else:[[List]][[Bomb Drone Bay]]|[[Decoy Drone Bay]]|[[Sensor Drone Bay]]|[[Splice Drone Bay]]|[[Thief Drone Bay]][[/List]]

This will be accompanied with the Log text [[GameText]]No threat detected, you may enter[[/GameText]]. The Exiles exit will only be on one of the two Mines depths. The following Log message will be shown when entering the Mines map with the exit: [[GameText]]Something is scanning the area.[[/GameText]]|[[Spoiler:Spoiler]][[Zion]] shortcut: A event with a friendly Derelict will create an exit leading to Zion. This will always skip a depth to -7 and is only available on -8 Mines after exiting a -9 Exiles map.[[/Spoiler]][[/List]][[Header]]Events[[/Header]]
There are a mix of friendly and hostile events that can occur in the Mines. While the friendly events can be very nice, some of the bad ones can easily be run-ending.

A few Assembled will also show up buried in the walls. Squads of [[T-07 Excavator|Tunnelers]] guarded by [[G-34 Mercenary|Grunts]] will be dispatched continuously every several hundred turns to dig out the collapsed tiles. Using a digging tool like a [[Mining Laser]] or [[Mining Claw]] is recommended to escape quicker.|(--) Assembled invasion: A large number of Assembled will appear and start attacking everything nearby. An [[C-30 ARC|ARC]] containing 2 [[D-53 Grenadier|Demolishers]] will be dispatched from the closest Materials exit and sent to the initial spawn location. A [[Guerrilla (5)|Derelict]] will appear next to you and tell you to run away as they provide a distraction. This event is extremly dangerous so early in the game as both the Assembled and Demolishers can deal a lot of damage very quickly. A launcher is highly recommended for dealing with the Assembled, while strong single-target weapons like kinetic cannons are ideal for dealing with the Demolishers. Getting stuck between them both is the worst case scenario and stripping to core and running is sometimes the only option to survive. A good tactic to avoid combat is to try to dig into the walls using a digging tool like a [[Mining Laser]] or [[Mining Claw]] and hide out of sight for a few hundred turns. Usually, most of the Assembled and Demolishers end up destroying each other.[[/List]]"

Recycling,Location,"Recycling is an early game [[0b10]]-controlled [[Branch]] with no hostile combat bots that is accessible only from [[Storage]]. The only 2 ways to enter this branch are by using the \\IAMDERELICT code at the Recycling exit in Storage or by entering a Storage [[Garrison]] and looping back into this floor instead of proceeding to the next depth. While there are no combat bots on this map, there are very large numbers of [[N-01 Spotter|Spotters]] that will scan Cogmind and report an oncoming threat. This adds 15 influence per Spotter, but that is not the real concern. The [[Alert]] on the following map will skyrocket after getting scanned many times and will usually contribute 900 influence. That puts a Cogmind with 0 influence exiting Recycling at alert level 3-N when entering the next map. Because of this, finding a way to purge alert via hacking or exiting into a [[Caves]] branch is highly recommended after visiting Recycling. Recycling is also unique in that is forces a skipped depth. For example, entering a Storage map on -8 leads to a Recycling map on -8 that leads to a [[Factory]] map on -6 rather than -7 like most branches.
For all its faults, this map does have some unique benefits. Because there are no combat reinforcements of any kind, there are few downsides to getting traced at all of the [[Terminal|Terminals]] and [[Recycling Machine|Recycling Machines]]. There are a large number of Recycling Machines on this map and using Force(Tunnel) on all of them can be very helpful in uncovering the depths of many maps in the floors above. There are commonly a large number of [[Corrupted Parts|Corrupted]] [[Authchip|Authchips]] available for players who want to do a lot of [[Fabricator|Fabrication]].
[[Header]]Prefabs[[/Header]]

Compared to many other branches, the Recycling prefabs tend to be very lackluster. The large collection of Authchips is the main unique reward for coming to this branch, although this is not a guaranteed reward. It is possible to ammass a large army of rewired bots, although they all spawn fairly damaged. A large army is also not strongly advised because they will run amok trying to chase after the spotters that run away after being shot at. They also do not help with the Alert issues that are already caused by visiting this map. Other than that, the parts on the ground and in the [[Recycling Machine|Recycling Machines]] tend to be reasonably damaged and low rating and are not very exciting.
[[Header:2]]Exits[[/Header]]
There is only one type of exit in Recycling and it is a main access exit that will always lead to the [[Factory]] map that is 2 floors above the current depth.
[[Image]]Recycling Warlord Attack.png|Derelicts attacking Recycling[[/Image]]
[[Header]]Events[[/Header]]
There is a rare Recycling event where the floor is stormed by white colored friendly but uncontrollable [[Warlord]]-aligned Derelicts. They will beeline toward the exit, stopping only to shoot any [[N-01 Spotter|Spotters]] they encounter. On exiting the floor, a few squads of the Warlord bots will also spawn on the next map and roam around."

Storage,Location,"Storage is an early game [[0b10]]-controlled [[Branch]] with no unique rewards but plenty of good prototype parts. Storage maps tend to be fairly cramped just like [[Materials]] maps but with fewer patrols and many more [[Y-45 Defender|Sentries]] guarding individual rooms and corridors. There is an unusually high number of [[A-02 Transporter|Haulers]] in these maps. Destroying them for their loot is highly recommended on -9 and -8. On -7 however, many of the Haulers will begin summoning [[Reinforcement Squad|Reinforcements]] that can cause trouble. The majority of the [[Prototype Parts]] at this point in the game will be weapons or flight units, so players trying to prepare for a flight transition should consider visiting Storage on -9 or -8. Combat players should also consider Storage as a good way to stock up on early game weaponry. -7 Storage is considered generally inferior to [[Caves]] because Caves has the advnate of [[Alert]] reduction as well as unique branch rewards.
Storage is notable for the large number of prototype parts available. Unique shell and vaults contain many useful early game loot. Vaults can also contain out-of-depth parts. Storage is also notable for the mostly guaranteed [[Garrison]]. It is the only way to enter a Garrison on -9.
[[Header]]Prefabs[[/Header]][[Images]]Storage Locked Vault.png|Locked vault of non-prototype parts|Storage Trapped Vault.png|Unlocked vault full of high rating parts with a row of traps in the way|Storage Drone Bay Vault.png|Locked vault full of drone bays|Storage Locked Large Vault.png|Large locked vault|Storage Grunt Vault.png|Unlocked vault full of friendly [[G-34 Mercenary]] and one [[G-47 Trooper]] Grunts that activate automatically|Storage Shell Prototypes.png|Shell with prototype parts|Storage Shells Non Prorotype.png|Shells with non-prototype parts|Storage Main Exit.png|Storage main access exit|Storage Recycling Entrance.png|Entrance to [[Recycling]][[/Images]]
All of the special loot in Storage comes in the form of vaults and shells. The shells will only contain standard floor rating non-prototype and prorotype parts. However, some of the vaults contain very out of depth prototype parts. The single item locked vault and the vault full of traps can contain rating 5* prototypes that are far out of depth compared to the normal Storage depths. These vaults can contain great items like [[Cld. Plasma Cannon]], [[Exp. Targeting Computer]], and even a semi-unique part [[Lgt. Regenerative Plating]]. Shells must be broke open by a weapon, while vaults must be hacked open via [[Terminal]]. Some vaults will already be open on entering the map.
[[Header:2]]Exits[[/Header]]
There are 2 types of exits in Storage:
