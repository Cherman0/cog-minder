01-MTF,Bot,"[[Image]]MTF Vault.png|Running into MTF in a [[Storage]] vault[[/Image]]A friendly bot that rarely shows up in [[Storage]] in an already opened vault. Will join you as an uncontrollable purple ally for the duration of the map and uses [[01-MTF's Autohacker]] to automatically open any other vaults it can see. It will assimilate or destroy most enemies it encounters extremely quickly with its high spectrum high damage EM gun [[01-MTF's Shockpuncher]].It disappears after leaving the map, so applying positive salvage with something like a [[Plasma Cutter]] and destroying this bot before leaving the floor is highly recommended to get some very good loot early in the game. The Shockpuncher in particular is a very powerful weapon that is strong throughout the majority of the game as long as you can deal with its short range."

Archives,Location,"Archives is a [[0b10]]-controlled [[Factory]] [[Branch]] that appears between -6 and -4. It is part of the [[Extension]] branch line and can only be entered through [[Cetus]]. It is a lightly guarded static map that has the same layout every time. There are 4 [[Sentry|Sentries]] and a large number of [[O-32 Director|Operators]]. Except for 1 special map variation, all 4 of the Archive Hub machines are useless and contain no data. No normal squads can spawn on this map.
This is a safe map to to wait around to dissipate [[Alert]] and purge corruption with the [[Imp. System Restoration Module|System Restoration Modules]] dropped by the Operators. It is also a great place to build up [[Hackware]] dropped by the Operators.

[[Image]]Archives Explosions.gif|Explosives set off by Zhirov[[/Image]]There are 2 variations of the Archives map:
[[List]]Standard: In the normal map, the Archive Hub machines only contain corrupted data. There are 4 Sentries and many active Operators.|[[Zhirov]] infiltrated map: Rarely, Zhirov will infiltrate Archives. In seeds where this occurs, he will not be found in his normal [[Zhirov (Location)|location]] This variant is recognizable by the lack of Sentry guards and the Operators all being broken. In these variants, the Archive Hub machine closest to Zhirov can be decoded for some Lore records. Soon after speaking with Zhirov, the intrusion will be detected and a large amount of 0b10 bots will be sent to investigate. Don't join in the fight and instead grab the Terminal lore (if not gotten yet) and make a beeline for the exits. After a second wave of bots are sent, Zhirov and friends will teleport out and rig some explosives to go off soon. You don't want to get caught in the blast.[[/List]]

Armory,Location,"Armory is a [[0b10]]-controlled [[Factory]]/[[Research]] [[Branch]] that apperas between -4 and -3. It is a tough map with tight corridors, few available paths, an above average number of patrols, and special dormant and guard bots. There are several unique types of patrols on this map as well, with a [[Demolisher]] leading a squad of [[Grunt|Grunts]] and [[Duelist]] squads with a [[Protector]] in tow. Stealth builds will have a difficult time of sneaking past unnoticed and combat bots must be ready to do a lot of killing to get by. If Cogmind can survive, some of the rewards are rewirable allies, a high number of [[Fabricator|Fabricators]], and large stockpiles of out-of-depth parts.
The overall map structure varies, but there are some common features of Armory maps. There are usually corridors running horizontally on the bottom and top of the map that contain large rooms next to each other connected by Emergency Access doors. The map can be a little maze-like although heading to the left and crossing from bottom to top or top to bottom will usually lead to an exit.
[[Heading:2]]Special Machines[[/Heading]]
There is one type of special machine in Armory. The Energy Cycler is a large explosive machine that will open all Sealed Heavy Doors on the map and summon several patrols. These Sealed Heavy Doors have hackable Terminals and contain high rating part stockpiles, sometimes full of entirely non-faulty [[Prototype Parts]].

Caves,Location,"Caves is the most frequent [[Branch]] map throughout all of [[Factory]] depths. It is a non-[[0b10]]-controlled map where [[Derelict|Derelicts]] often roam free and hostile 0b10 squads patrol and can be taken out without fear of reinforcements. Non-patrolling 0b10 outposts guarded by a [[Sentry]] and dormant bots are common. Every depth has 2 guaranteed Caves exits and each Caves map is a part of a series of 3 maps in a row. Not counting event-based exits, all first Caves maps of each depth can only be exited by entering the second Caves map. Caves maps do not have very many regular parts on the ground, but piles of [[Scrap]] contain usable but partially damaged parts and [[Derelict Log|Derelict Logs]] can give unique intel about upcoming floors.
There are different names for the different types of Caves maps and they have slightly different characteristics. Lower Caves is the name given to the first 2 Caves maps on -7 and -6, while Caves maps on -5 and -4 are named Upper Caves. The third caves map is accessible only by exiting the depth-specific special branch at the left side of the second caves map and is called Proximity Caves, regardless of depth. Lower and Upper Caves are very similar in all but [[Robot Tier]], but Proximity Caves tends to be more densely populated with patrols.
Caves are patrolled fairly lightly by hostile 0b10 bots compared to the main floors. [[Infowar]] utilities are a good option to avoid unnecessary encounters as many patrols can be avoided with a bit of patience. Caves have a unique mechanic where parts dropped from 0b10 bots will automatically self-destruct after a few turns. Looting must be done quickly or else the dropped parts will be lost forever. The only 2 ways around this mechanic are [[Self-destruct Interrupter|Self-destruct Interrupters]] and [[Electromagnetic Weapons]]. The interrupters will prevent the parts from frying while active and EM damage will interfere with the self-destruct mechanism. While EM will give [[Corrupted Parts]], it is far better to end up with corrupted parts than to end up with no parts at all.
Due to the low rate of good parts spawning on the floor and the overall difficulty in looting hostile 0b10 bots, it is very easy for an unprepared build to fall apart in these maps. Bringing plenty of spares into Caves is highly recommended to avoid running out of essentials like propulsion, weapons, and armor. [[Launchers]] are a must here to handle ambushes of large numbers of 0b10 bots hiding in outposts. Launchers are also incredibly useful when entering a Caves map because the standard spawn protection that is present in 0b10 maps doesn't apply here. That means that one (or more) patrols can appear right in Cogmind's face on entering a map.
[[Heading:2]]Lore[[/Heading]]
[[Lore]]0b10 Records|Caves[[/Lore]]
[[Heading]]Navigation[[/Heading]]
Cave maps all have a very similar overall layout. While the paths within the caves are unpredictable, these maps can typically be divided into 6 equal chunks. Top left, top middle, top right, bottom left, bottom middle, and bottom right. Cogmind will always spawn from the top right or bottom right chunks in Lower and Upper Caves or the top left or bottom left chunks in Proximity caves. One exit will always be in the chunk furthest from Cogmind. In the second Lower or Upper Caves map, the unique branch exit will be in that furthest chunk and the exit back to the main floor will always be on the same side. A good rule of thumb is that left is away from 0b10 while right is toward 0b10.

Caves has one of the largest collections of prefabs of all the maps in the game There is a wide mix of good and bad prefabs. One of the strongest prefabs, the Tinkerer with a [[Core Expander]], is so strong that it alone can be a good reason to go into Caves. The most common encounters on this map tend to be the many different forms of 0b10 outposts. [[Transmission Jammer|Transmission Jammers]] are highly recommended to take bots in these outposts out one at a time without getting overwhelmed. In some hostile encounters, [[Sentry|Sentries]] can call for a reinforcement [[Assault Squad]]. In the first Caves map each depth only no reinforcements will come as there is no 0b10-controlled exit. Killing the Sentries as quickly as possible is highly recommended in all other cases. Fighting these outposts is a bad idea for an unprepared build, but larger outposts with Terminal intel are very vaulable. This intel can be the same as the intel found in [[Derelict Log|Derelict Logs]].
Friendly Derelicts will not move from their guard position, but they will engage any 0b10 forces they see. Leading hostile squads into them can let them do the fighting for you. This is particularly easy to do for fast airborne builds who don't want to engage in combat and can use the Derelicts as a distraction. These Derelicts can also be safely salvaged for parts and will not retaliate.

Cetus,Location,"Cetus is a [[0b10]]-controlled [[Factory]] branch between -6 and -4 that can only be entered through [[Extension]]. This map is the same every game with no variation. There are 2 groups of a [[Watcher]] + 4 [[Cetus Guard|Cetus Guards]]. One is on the bottom left side of the map and the other is on the top right. In the center is the Cetus Manufacturing Module machine, a few scattered lore [[Terminal|Terminals]], and a Terminal that locks up the Cetus Mainframe.
If [[A7]] is rescued and kept alive, they will provide a special Terminal hack for the manufacturing module that will create 5 Cogmind-controlled [[Enhanced Grunt|Enhanced Grunts]]. A7 also has a special interaction upon seeing the Cetus Mainframe. After exiting the map, they will give a special robot hack that [[Spoiler:Redacted]]decreases the reaction time of [[MAIN.C]], causing them to take much longer to attack[[/Spoiler]].
One special bot appears on this map: [[Revision 17]]. After destroying all 8 Cetus Guards, they will appear and thank you for freeing them. If both Revision 17 and the Cetus Manufacturing Module are still intact when leaving the map, there will be a special -3 [[Research]] event where Revision 17 attacks the map.
There are no standard [[Extermination Squad|Exterminations]] or [[Assault Squad|Assaults]] on this map. However, there is a special patrol [[C-30 ARC|ARC]] spawn. 750 turns after entering the map and every further 250 turns, 2 ARCs will spawn from random exits and roam around the map. It is best to exit the map before too many of these ARCs start showing up.
[[Heading:2]]Lore[[/Heading]]
[[Lore]]Cetus Records|Cetus Mainframe[[/Lore]]
[[Heading]]Strategy[[/Heading]]
The [[Cetus Guard|Cetus Guards]] are not too tough of foes and have some very nice loot, especially the [[Adv. KE Penetrator]], [[Centrium Heavy Treads]], [[Centrium Medium Armor Plating]]. They have an above average amount of core integrity but no critical destroy immunity or EM resistance, so destroy crit and EM weapons tend to be the most effective. EM Launchers are particularly effective at taking out each chunk of 4 in a short amount of time. There will be some [[Corrupted Parts|corrupted]] parts, but this loot is definitely worth the corruption. 
Cogmind will often have a big group of allies from Extension. These can be helpful and harmful at the same time. Too many allies will just get in the way of each other and you, so telling some controllable allies to stay back is often a good idea. While the [[Guerrilla (5)|Guerillas]] have -Salvage from their [[Bore Cannon]], they tend to perform very well against the Cetus Guards due to their very high critical destroy chance.
To best preserve the Cetus Manufacturing Module for the A7 code or Revision 17 events, tell all controllable allies to stay at the first intersection after killing the first set of Cetus Guards. This will cause any ARCs that spawn from the top-left exit to fight those allies out of the way. Otherwise, Enhanced Grunts being created via the A7 code will often fight right in front of the module and cause the machine to get destroyed by wandering patrols trying to fight.
The Cetus Mainframe door has a very low base success rate of 10%. While [[Hackware]] can help out here, the Cetus Guards can conveniently drop a [[Adv. Variable Charge Gun]] which can be overloaded to destroy the Sealed Heavy Doors. Otherwise, any rating 3 or higher [[Impact Weapons|Impact Weapon]] can destroy the Reinforced Barrier around it.

The left 2 contain mostly lore records, although the top-left Terminal will also list the depth of [[Section 7]] as well as the access code to the [[Warlord (Location)|Warlord]] Prototype Stash. These two vary per run so make sure to grab these lore entries every time. The bottom ones do not contain any additional information each run. The top-right Terminal will contain several random bot [[Schematic|Schematics]] and the bottom-right Terminal will contain a large number of part schematics and a few Prototype ID Banks. The part schematics will always contain schematics for [[Combat Drone Bay]] and [[Lgt. Regenerative Plating]].
[[Heading]]Alignment[[/Heading]]
Talking with the Data Miner will result in a permanent alignment bonus that does not have any incompatibilities. [[Investigation Squad|Investigations]], [[Reinforcement Squad|Reinforcements]], and [[Assault Squad|Assaults]] on all [[0b10]]-controlled floors have a chance to be redirected to another random place on the map. For Reinforcements and Assaults, this will result in their permanent repositioning. This is a benefit most of the time, although on cramped maps it can be a downside because bots can be grouped together at bad positions. Additionally, several door terminals will automatically open with the Log message [[GameText]]Door Terminal flashes as you approach.[[/GameText]] This will happen at all of the locked cells in [[Extension]] as well as locked entrance prefabs to Extension, [[Quarantine]], and [[Section 7]].
[[Heading:2]]Data Conduit[[/Heading]]
There is a second secret alignment to this map. After the Data Miner is attacked and either killed or trap-doored off the map it is possible to step into and use his Data Conduit machine. Doing so will provide many benefits and some major penalties. The rewards are:
[[List]]All obtainable analyses in the game|All [[Prototype Parts|Prototype]] IDs|All interactive and non-interactive machine intel|[[Spoiler:Redacted]]The ability to decrypt the [[Lab]] Terminal and see the Lab scanner tiles[[/Spoiler]]|[[Spoiler:Redacted]]Manual bot hacking [[Datajacks|Datajack]] codes that can be used to destroy all ""A"" bots on sight[[/Spoiler]][[/List]]
The downsides are:
[[List]][[Intercept Squad|Intercepts]] will be dispatched on most 0b10-controlled floors|No more [[Enhanced Grunt]] backup when turning [[Warlord]] hostile on the -2 [[Research]] assault|The group of disabled [[Grunt|Grunts]] in [[Armory]] will turn hostile rather than friendly when awakened|[[Spoiler:Redacted]][[Enhanced Programmer|Enhanced Programmers]] will appear in [[Access_0]][[/Spoiler]][[/List]]
The upsides are quite strong but the downsides are very deadly to all but the most prepared Cogmind. [[Tracker|Trackers]] can easily chew up any airborne build with their deadly [[Immobilizer]] to halt any chance of escape with their highly accurate [[Linked Autogun]] to put out the damage. Adequately prepared combat builds can usually dispatch the Trackers without too much trouble and use their Linked Autoguns to great effect. Each Tracker will also summon a [[Combat Programmer]] which is a high-damaging foe that will quickly rack up corruption. Unlike [[Extermination Squad|Exterminations]], Intercepts are move-based and not tile-based and tends to punish airborne builds relatively more than combat builds. When using the Data Conduit, Cogmind should either be prepared to exit maps quickly to avoid Intercept encounters or have a plan to fight.
[[Heading]]Fighting[[/Heading]]
Killing the Data Miner himself is highly luck based with only a few ways to improve the chances. A successful Data Miner kill can yield up to 4 pieces of Prototype Hackware at an early depth. Ranged weapons are almost entirely out of the question because he will escape after the first weapon in a volley. However, melee weapon follow-ups will not cause the trap door to activate in between the volley. The primary ways to increase kill chance are to:
[[List]]Use as many weapon slots with melee weapons as possible|Use [[Actuator Arrays]] to increase followup chance|Use [[Core Analyzers]] to increase core hit chance|Use [[Momentum]] to increase damage|Use [[Force Boosters]] to increase damage[[/List]]
One alternate approach is to use the [[Field Lobotomy Kit]] to assimilate the Data Miner before killing to guarantee a kill. Using a [[Plasma Cutter]] as well can almost guarantee all 4 pieces of Hackware as a drop. It is safe to do this on this map without attracting hostilities.
[[Heading:2]][[Enhanced Grunt|Enhanced Grunts]][[/Heading]]
[[Image]]Data Miner Combat Dig.png|Digging through the Data Conduit to fight Grunts[[/Image]]
After the Data Miner is attacked these grunts hidden in the wall will burst out and become aggressive. These Grunts have some nice loot for the depth, particularly their [[Neutron Cannon]], [[Adv. Energy Well]], [[Adv. Particle Charger]], and [[Enh. Flexi-carbon Leg|Enh. Flexi-carbon Legs]]. There are several good ways to dispatch these Grunts:
[[Image]]Data Miner Escape Dig.png|Digging through the Data Conduit to escape[[/Image]]
[[List]]Plant [[Dirty Bomb Trap|Dirty Bomb Traps]] next to the Grunt spawn positions. Refer to the empty holes near the top right in the location map up above. They have a minor resistance to EM damage, but a full [[Imp. Trap Extractor]] will typically take out most of them. These can often be found in caves by looting [[Minesweeper|Minesweepers]].|Use 2 or more [[Launchers]] and fight them all at once. Explosive launchers will be slower and provide little to no loot but can have a nice range advantage over the Grunts' below average 14 range. EM launchers have a smaller range but will provide a decent amount of loot, although it will be [[Corrupted Parts|Corrupted]].|Dig a tunnel deep into the Data Conduit machine and hide out inside. The Grunts will spread out over time and you can lure them in to fight 1-on-1. This approach works best with some kind of [[Transmission Jammers|Transmission Jammer]] to avoid drawing more than one Grunt at a time. This is the best tactic to fight Grunts with melee or conventional non-launcher methods.[[/List]]
Another approach is to simply run from the Grunts. This works best for airborne builds as they can get in and out with the fewest number of shots. Digging a tunnel through the Data Conduit machine is also very helpful for escaping. Luring the Grunts into a tunnel as you escape out the other end can avoid most attacks. Flight can hop over the grouped-up Grunts and dodge into the spawn areas to avoid more shots"

Executioner,Bot,
Exiles,Location,"The Exiles map appears as a [[Branch]] off of [[Mines]] on either -10 or -9 and is home to the Exiles, a group of friendly Derelict Tinkerer outcasts made up of [[EX-BIN]], [[EX-DEC]], [[EX-HEX]], and their bodyguard [[8R-AWN]]. These Exiles have a large collection of unique prototype parts that are only available in the Exiles vault. The entrance is guarded by some rigged engines that blow up when a hostile bot crosses them. There are some lore terminals with entries written by each of the tinkerers that describe many of the prototype parts obtainable on this map as well as some that are not. The terminal near the center of the map also contains a log entry that points to the depth that [[Zion]] is on. Various caches of storage units and energy/matter storage can be found throughout the map. ""The Gauntlet"" at the bottom of the map is a stretch of tester bots that are working on the latest batch of prototype parts. These Derelicts have names that reference Cogmind community members. This map is also home to the [[Farcom]] machine and a unique alignment.
Carrying a [[Datajack]] into this map is recommended due to all of the prototype parts that the Exiles and 8R-AWN have on them. Parsing them will provide the associated prototype part IDs so you can recognize the parts later.
Be wary of [[Corruption]] on this map. There is no way to cleanse corruption and misfires become possible at 1% corruption. One misfire hitting the wrong thing will result in the whole map turning aggressive and death will likely follow. Detaching all ranged weapons is recommended if Cogmind has any corruption.
[[Heading]]Alignment[[/Heading]]
Using the Farcom machine grants an 18-radius permanent combat bot sensor in any [[0b10]] controlled maps and one of the special vault items. If Farcom abilities are retained it is impossible to [[Imprint]] in the same run and entering any research branches will have massive consequences. [[Spoiler:Spoiler]]On entering maps like [[Testing]] and [[Quarantine]], [[Maximum Security]] will be triggered.[[/Spoiler]] If those branches can be avoided, Farcom can provide some great advantages to help players with permanent itemless sensor abilities.
3 random items will be present in the vault in most games. Here is the list of Exiles specific vault items that can be obtained with Farcom:[[List]][[0b10 Alert Chip]]|[[Army-in-a-Box]]|[[AWS/Autocannon]]|[[AWS/Gauss]]|[[AWS/Thermal]]|[[Chronowheel]]|[[Cloak of Protection]]|3 [[Deploy-a-Sentry]]|[[Field Lobotomy Kit]]|[[Firepult]]|[[Flying Fortress v7]]|[[Gui.

[[Heading:2]]Alignment Options[[/Heading]]
There are more ways to interact with Farcom without just taking a single vault item. Here are all of the outcomes:[[List]]Use Farcom machine, take 0-1 vault items: Permanently gain Farcom and the use of the vault item taken.|Use Farcom machine, take 2-3 vault items: Gain Farcom until [[Factory]] is reached. After that, the Exiles notice that you are a thief and will remove Farcom. [[Master Thief|Master Thieves]] will sometimes ambush you at the entrance/exits in [[Caves]] maps and rip parts off of your body and from your inventory. They will prioritize high rating parts and Exiles prototypes.|Use Farcom machine (or don't), attack Exiles and leave the map with 0 vault items: Lose Farcom instantly. The Exiles will become aggressive and send [[Assembled (4)|Assembled]], a [[DAS Turret]], and [[8R-AWN]] to kill you. After leaving the map, there is a chance that a hostile [[Z-Hero]] will spawn and attack you. Note: Using vault items on the map is safe as long as no items actually leave the map.|Use Farcom machine, attack Exiles and leave the map with 1 or more vault items: The same as above except you get Master Thieves in caves as described above.[[/List]]
[[Heading]]Variations[[/Heading]]
There are several variations of the Exiles map that can change things dramatically. In the majority of maps, the Exiles are present. However, there are 2 possible variations in the maps:
[[Image]]Exiles Attacked.png|Attacked Exiles vault[[/Image]][[List]]Abandoned Exiles: In this map, the Exiles have all fled the map and taken nearly everything on the map as well. Neither Farcom nor any vault items are obtainable in this seed. However, EX-DEC may be found in [[Spoiler:Spoiler]][[Warlord (Location)|Warlord]] in the Vortex Lab[[/Spoiler]] in these seeds.|Attacked Exiles: In this map, the Exiles have been attacked and are missing. There are disabled and rewirable bots on the map and random parts on the ground. Farcom is not obtainable on this seed, but one random vault prototype is available by using the manual code [[Spoiler:Spoiler]]\\1234[[/Spoiler]] on the vault terminal.|While not changing the map in any way, there is a chance that a large [[0b10]] attack force will assault the Exiles base after using the Farcom machine and exiting the vault.[[/List]]
[[Heading]]Fighting[[/Heading]]
Fighting the Exiles is a challenging yet rewarding endeavor. Although they are normally friendly, they can pack quite a punch and will likely end the run of any unprepared player. As far as rewards go, [[8R-AWN]] has some powerful unique [[8R-AWN's Boregun|Boreguns]] with a high salvage and destroy critical %, out-of-depth parts including [[Exp. Heat Sink]], [[Adv. Weapon Cycler]], [[Exp. Targeting Computer]], and [[Adv. Myomer Leg]]. Another unique part, the [[AS-neutralizer No. 17b]] is very helpful in a later game branch [[Zion Deep Caves]]. Other useful parts on some of the Exiles themselves are [[Adv. Component Analysis Suite]], [[System Purifier]], [[Cmb. Antigrav System]], [[Imp. Armor Integrity Analyzer]], [[Exp. Core Analyzer]], and [[Adv. Transmission Jammer]].
[[Image]]Exiles Kill Build.png|Example Exiles kill build[[/Image]]
Fighting the Exiles is not recommended on -10 due to lower slot count, lower core integrity, and difficulty in getting enough integrity to survive the 8R-AWN fight. If fighting on -9, evolving a 3rd weapon slot can be very effective in killing 8R-AWN and any potential [[Z-Hero|Z-Heroes]] that might spawn in the next Mines map. The third weapon slot is not required to kill by any means, however, and any combination of weapon, utility, and propulsion slots for the evolve will work. As a basic checklist, the following parts are recommended:[[List]]Multiple kinetic guns with backups, ideally [[Hvy. Assault Rifle|Hvy. Assault Rifles]] or [[Imp. Assault Rifle|Imp. Assault Rifles]], weapons with negative salvage like [[Shotgun]] or a ballistic cannon like [[Imp. Light Cannon]] can work but 8R-AWN has very strong loot that is nice to get if possible|Multiple pieces of armor, preferably [[Hrd. Light Armor Plating]] or [[Med. Armor Plating]]|Multiple [[Lgt. Treads]] or [[Imp. Treads]] with backups|At least one launcher like [[Grenade Launcher]], [[Mni. Grenade Launcher]], or [[Rocket Launcher]]|(Optional) A way to gain positive salvage like a [[Plasma Cutter]] or [[Salvage Targeting Computer]], in a pinch ramming 8R-AWN can provide a bit of salvage (+3 per ram)|(Optional) [[Blade Trap|Blade Traps]] for 8R-AWN or [[Explosive Trap|Explosive Traps]] for the Assembled, if an early trap extractor or trap stockpile are found in Mines[[/List]]
[[Image]]Exiles Kill.png|A visual guide to killing the Exiles[[/Image]]
There are some things that should be done before actually doing the fight itself. The image on the right serves as a visual reference. Any rigged engines used must be in inventory before attacking the Exiles, otherwise the engines will still remain loyal to the Exiles and explode only on Cogmind. Traps should also be set before any hostilities begin. Blade Traps should be placed along the north edge of the wall after 8R-AWN to ensure that they are triggered and Explosive Traps should be placed next to the [[Assembled (4)|Assembled]] to hit them while they are grouped up together. Matter pods should be relocated near the 8R-AWN fighting spot (See point #4 in diagram) to avoid running out of matter in combat. Any allies should be told to stay in the same general area so they can contribute to the fight. However, Grunts can't deal much damage until [[8R-AWN's Armor/TH]] is destroyed. Finally, some vault items may come in handy for the fight. The [[Cloak of Protection]]'s effect is not so strong, but when turned off it is a high coverage high integrity piece of armor. The [[Longsword +1]] is a very effective kill tool. The [[Potential Leg|Potential Legs]] have a lot of integrity in case you run out of propulsion during the fight. The [[Gui. Plasma Cannon]] may be used to safely destroy the [[DAS Turret]] without getting attacked back. One thing to consider about the vault is that there may be a 0b10 attack on the Exiles after exiting. In those cases, an Exiles kill may either have to be cancelled or at least turned into a 8R-AWN only kill. Aside from that, the fight may begin:
[[Image]]Exiles Launcher DAS.png|Launchering the DAS turret[[/Image]]
[[List:Ordered]]Shoot one of the spike-shaped machines to turn the Exiles hostile.|Drop the rigged engines from the entrance every few tiles while walking toward the spot for step #3, they have an explosion radius of 2. This will take care of most of the Assembled that are coming your way. IMPORTANT: This must be done after the Exiles become hostile. If you do it before that, they will explode on Cogmind.|Pull out a Launcher and dispose of the remaining Assembled.|Go to the corner to fight 8R-AWN. This is the part that needs the most backups, as 8R-AWN will destroy many of your parts very quickly due to high damage and high part destroy critical chance. Always put on backup parts right away after they are destroyed. Make sure to apply salvage with a Plasma Cutter if you have it before finishing the kill. You may run out of matter and have to refill from matter pods at this point, which is why preemptively moving the matter pods here can be very important. Many kill attempts that don't have enough damage or integrity will end here.|Hopefully you have some good loot after 8R-AWN is destroyed. [[8R-AWN's Boregun|Boreguns]] are a very easy way to destroy the [[DAS Turret]]. Penetrate through the machines to try and kill the turret without getting shot at because the cannon deals incredibly high damage. If no Boreguns were dropped, using a launcher is another good option. The idea is to aim around the spike in the machine so that you can't get hit but the explosion radius will still hit the turret.|Finally, all that is left is to loot the Exiles and their Derelict friends. Apply positive salvage to the Exiles with a Plasma Cutter if possible. Otherwise just finish them off with whatever you have left. Watch out for [[EX-DEC]] as they have a deadly [[AWS/EX-DEC]] that can deal a lot of damage very quickly if you aren't careful. It has a short range, so just take them out from a distance.[[/List]]"

Extension,Location,"Extension is a [[Factory]] [[Branch]] that appears between -6 and -4 and serves as a connection between the main [[0b10]] complex and [[Cetus]]. It is the beginning of a 4-map sequences of branches that spans Extension, Cetus, [[Archives]], and [[Hub_04(d)]]. It is an 0b10-controlled map with a small amount of patrols and moderate amount of guards spread throughout. There are a large amount of non-combat bots moving in between [[Transfer Station|Transfer Stations]] at the left and right-most parts of the map. Unlike most 0b10-controlled maps, [[Extermination Squad|Exterminations]] will not spawn in Extension. The central area is heavily guarded with 2 [[Behemoth|Behemoths]] and 2 [[Sentry|Sentries]] standing by.
The overall map shape is similar to a large B turned on its side. This map shape is the same between runs, although every map has random contents. There is a single bottom path that runs straight to the main Factory/Cetus exits and 2 branching paths that contain some machines and disabled and imprisoned [[Derelict|Derelicts]]. One special NPC, [[A7]], is nearly always guaranteed to be locked in one of the cells. The central area has the aforementioned guards stationed as well as a [[Terminal]]-locked exit. The bottom path to either side of the central area can have Emergency Access doors along the top or bottom of the path. These can contain hostile guards, part caches, or nothing.
One unique mechanic to Extension is the persistant threat check. If too many non-combat bots are attacked and destroyed, an alert with the text [[GameText]]ALERT: Persistant threat to transfer network, dispatching additional forces.[[/GameText]] will appear, and 2 [[C-30 ARC|ARCs]] will be dispatched to patrol the map.
[[Heading:2]]Special Machines[[/Heading]]
There are two types of special machines in Extension. The first, the Transfer Station, is a machine that normally transports non-combat bots. When destroyed, each one will reduce the number of non-combat robots on all 0b10-controlled maps by a stacking 50% amount. Note that this does not include [[Researcher|Researchers]]. The other, Energy Cyclers, will open all Sealed Heavy Doors simulatenously when destroyed and summon several ARCs to patrol the map. This will free all of the locked up Derelicts and they will start heading in Cogmind's direction, fighting every hostile they see. Destroying either of these machines can be either good or bad, although the energy cycler effect is almost always bad.
[[Heading:2]]Lore[[/Heading]]
[[Lore]]0b10 Records|Extension[[/Lore]]
[[Heading]]Strategy[[/Heading]]The strategy for Extension is a fairly simple one. From the spawn location, take the path to the top-left of the map. Travel along the right and destroy any hostiles. Rewiring and freeing bots in cells is an option at this point, but it is usually better to wait to do this to keep [[Alert]] lower and to preserve ally integrity for the center fight. When you reach the center area where the only path is down, there are 2 primary options:
[[List]]Head back and loop back around counter-clockwise to the center of the map. Free/rewire any allies along the way. Take on the first Behemoth alone, then keep moving forward with your allies to finish the rest of the center area off.|Dig through the top-center part of the map. This is about 10 tiles long and is a risky dig with a high chance of one or more cave-ins. For a build with no allies and no good way to take on the central area, this may be a better risk to take than a head-on fight.[[/List]]
After that, clear the top right section of the map to collect as many allies as possible, then head to the exits.

Factory,Location,"Factory is a [[0b10]]-controlled main floor that occurs on every floor between -7 and -4. It is the beginning of the midgame where the game really starts to open up. In stark contrast with earlier [[Materials]] maps, Factory start out huge with a ~200x200 tile map size. The rooms, the corridors, and the overall layout are all much wider and more open and connected than Materials. The patrols and guards are more spread out and stealth play with airborne propulsion and [[Infowar]] becomes a strong gameplay option.
[[Alert]] starts to be more of a concern as the maps become bigger and harder to traverse. [[Hackware]] is useful to be able to successfully use Access hacks at terminals to locate exits. [[Signal Interpreter|Signal Interpreters]] will also be more useful at identifying exits as the exit types will be less predictable. [[Caves]] exits are available in every Factory map. They can be difficult if a player is unprepared, but they can provide many unique rewards and will typically result in a complete Alert purge by the time Cogmind makes it back to the next main floor.
As [[Extermination Squad|Exterminations]] become a regular occurrence, a large part of a build's effectiveness becomes how quickly Cogmind can kill Programmers. [[Corruption]] can build up very quickly if fighting multiple Programmers in open areas without a good way to kill them. Having strong thermal or kinetic weaponry is a good way to destroy them quickly. For lighter airborne builds, non-Impact melee weapons can work, although using Hackware to recall Exterminations is also very effective. This tends to be more important in later depths as Exterminations will upgrade from a single [[P-60 Hacker]] to 1-2 [[P-70 Sage]] per squad.
There are many new mechanics introduced beginning in Factory floors:

[[Heading:2]]Exits[[/Heading]]
There are 4 types of main exits on Factory floors:
[[List]]Main access exits: These always lead to the next main floor, either Factory or [[Research]]. Sometimes these exits can be identifiable by a 5 tile wide corridor leading to a dead-end with the exit in the middle. All other types of exits that aren't a part of a prefab can be either a main or branch exit. There will always be 4 of these exits per Factory map.|[[Caves]] exit: These exits can never be identified purely by looks. Using a [[Signal Interpreter]] or access hack to identify exits are the main ways to do so. There will always be 2 of these exits per Factory map.|[[Spoiler:Spoiler]][[Extension]] exit: Extension can always be identified by a distinctive prefab where a large area is sealed off by orange Blast Doors. These doors can be open or locked. If locked, the nearby [[Terminal]] will have an Open hack available to open the doors. Otherwise, shooting the walls open with strong thermal weaponry, causing an engine detonation with an EM launcher, or strong melee attacks can dig through or around these doors. Factory maps at the same depth as Extension will have 2 Extension exits.[[/Spoiler]]|[[Spoiler:Spoiler]][[Armory]] exit: Armory can always be identified in Factory by a large 5 tile corridor leading into a 3 tile doorway. These exits will always be heavily guarded by a mix of [[Y-72 Warden|Sentries]] and [[G-67 Veteran|Grunts]] and have large stockpiles of weapons nearby. Factory maps at the same depth as Armory will have 1 of these types of exit.[[/Spoiler]][[/List]]
[[Image]]Factory DSF Exit.png|Hacked open DSF exit[[/Image]]
Several non-standard exits also appear in Factory. [[Chute Trap|Chute Traps]] will throw Cogmind into [[Wastes]] which can end many good runs if unprepared. Using a [[Datajack]] on a [[K-01 Serf|Serf]] for the find_chute hack is very effective to either reveal traps to avoid or areas to head toward if planning to take on the [[C-40 Crusher|Crushers]] in combat. The other type of exit is a [[DSF]]. These exits can be hacked open at distinctive DSF terminals but will automatically lock upon being spotted by any hostile. Stealth or good luck is required to make it to these exits."

Hub_04(d),Location,"Hub is a [[0b10]]-controlled [[Factory]] [[Branch]] that appears betwen -6 and -4. It is part of the [[Extension]] branch line and can only be entered through [[Archives]]. It is much more similar to normal floors than the rest of the Extension branch maps where all of the normal squad types can spawn regularly.
[[Heading:2]]Special Machines[[/Heading]]
There are two types of special machines in Hub. The first, the [[Transfer Station]], is also common to Extension. When destroyed, it will reduce the number of non-combat robots on all 0b10-controlled maps by a stacking 50%. Note that this does not include [[Researcher|Researchers]].
[[Image]]Hub Explosion.gif|A Network Hub explosion[[/Image]]The other, the Network Hub, is a large EM explosive machine. When destroyed, it will reduce all machine hacking trace capabilities by 20%. Every futher hub destroyed reduces by half that amount rounded down. In total, defenses are decreased by 20%, 30%, 35%, and 37%. This is equivalent to the first effect of defensive [[Hackware]]. A 20% tracing decrease is equivalent to wearing 2 base-tier [[System Shield|System Shields]]. Another effect of destroying a Network Hub is that 3 squads of 3 [[Lightning]] + 1 [[I-47 Archangel|Archangel]] will spawn from different exits and Garrisons. They will patrol around the remaining 3 Network Hubs are located. All non-combat bots will also be called to evacuate the map.
[[Heading:2]]Lore[[/Heading]]
[[Lore]]0b10 Records|Hub_04(d)[[/Lore]]
[[Heading]]Variations[[/Heading]]There are 3 variations of the Hub map:
[[List]]Network Hubs in corners: All 4 Network Hub machines will be in their own corners of the map. They are not likely to overlap in explosion radius and cause chain reactions.|Network Hubs on left side: All 4 Network Hub machines will be on the left side of the map. It is likely that either the top 2 or bottom 2 Hub machines will overlap in explosion radius and guarantee a chain reaction. It is very rarely possible for all 4 Hubs to chain together.|Network hubs on right side: Same as above but on the right side of the map.[[/List]]
[[Heading]]Strategy[[/Heading]]
Blowing up Network Hubs as soon as you see them is usually a bad idea. Shooting them directly causes a ton of [[Alert]] gain due to their large destructive radius. The Lightning squads that follow can also be very scary for an unprepared Cogmind. If unprepared to fight off the Lightning, it is a good idea to blow up the Hubs from a distance or right next an exit.
There are a lot of methods to blow up Network Hubs that do not trigger the alert gain:
[[List]]Hostile attack: If Cogmind stands in front of a Network Hub and a 0b10 bot misses into it, the destruction will be associated with that bot and not Cogmind. This also works well with allies and drones. Just position the ally in front of a Hub and attacking enemies can shoot around or through them to trigger the explosion.|[[Traps|Trap]] explosion: Traps never assign Alert to Cogmind no matter who is the one who triggers the trap. Any explosive traps will do the trick, and Cogmind can even self-trigger the trap with > without any Alert cost.|Force(Sabotage): If successful, this hack will blow up a random explosive machine on the map. Network Hubs are the only available targets so this will always work on this map. This hack is inconsistent and may fail multiple times in a row. This hack will cause an Alert gain of 50 if successful, but it is substantially less than the several hundred of a manually-blown Network Hub. Note: unlike this hack, Trojan(Detonate) does cause Alert to go up from the Explosion and is not a great hack to use.[[/List]]
The best way to deal with the [[Lightning]] squads is to use critical destroy weapons as they lack any critical immunity. [[8R-AWN's Boregun]], [[Adv. KE Penetrator]], and any Hyp. guns or cannons will work well. [[Damper Plating]] works great at reducing damage taken by Lightnings to negligible amounts. The [[Exp. EM Disruption Field]] that they carry can also do fine after being looted.

Lab,Location,"Lab is a [[Factory]]/[[Research]] branch between -4 and -3 that is only accessible from [[Armory]]. This map is fixed every game, with the only variations being variations in the guaranteed items. This secret lab is used as a safe spot by the [[A bots]] to plan and coordinate as well as research stolen [[Sigix]] technology. This area has a special effect where Cogmind's [[Alert]] drops to 0 upon entering the map.
Lab has a small square entrance and a 1 tile corridor that leads to the next main access exit and a Sealed Barrier with a [[Terminal]] locking it. There are a few different ways to get inside:
[[List]]Breaking in: The main Sealed Barrier blocking the way has 80 armor and high resistances, while the surrounding Rinforced Barriers have only 64 armor. Cutting through this is difficult without a strong [[Impact Weapons|Impact Weapon]] or overloadable thermal [[Energy Cannons|Energy Cannon]]. Coming in this way will result in being scanned immediately.|[[Zhirov (Location)]] code: One of the Terminals at Zhirov contains an access code to open up this barrier. Opening the Lab this way not result in being scanned.|Picking up the [[A7 Data Core]]: [[A7]] drops this item when killed. The doors will automatically open when approaching, and the message [[GameText]]A0_COM: WELCOME A7[[/GameText]] will appear in the log. This will also reveal the intruder detection lasers, but Cogmind will not be scanned immediately.|Using the [[Data Conduit]]: Using the Data Conduit in [[Data Miner (Location)]] will result in the doors opening automatically, the scanning lasers being visible, and no immediate scan.[[/List]]
[[Heading:2]]Getting Scanned[[/Heading]]
[[Image]]Lab Visible Lasers.png|Visible Lab intruder detecting lasers[[/Image]]
The lasers are invisible by default, although the A7 core and using the Data Conduit will reveal them. They are 3x3 squares of yellow tiles that move randomly. Every turn there is a chance that they will move in one of the cardinal directions. The center tiles cannot overlap with other lasers and they cannot move through walls, machines, or past the entrance of the Lab. Being within the 3x3 area will result in being scanned immediately. This will cause an announcement [[GameText]]A0_COM: INTRUDER ALERT[[/GameText]] and [[A5]] will show up and fight. This scan will also cause [[Intercept Squad|Intercepts]] to appear on most [[0b10]]-controlled floors. The other way to get scanned is to break either the outer wall of Reinforced Barriers or to destroy the Active System Cloaker machine on the right side of the map. Other machines are safe to break.
The inside of the Lab contains many unique item spawns. In counter-clockwise order starting from the entrance:
[[List]]Big machine on top right: [[Core Reset Matrix]]|[[Alien Artifact]] shell on top of map #1: [[Transdimensional Reconstructor]]|Shell #2: [[Integrated Dissipator]], [[Integrated Mediator]], or [[Integrated Reactor]]|Shell #3: [[Core Expander]] or [[Core Regenerator]]|Top left item spot #1: [[Deep Network Scanner]] or [[Quantum Router]]|Item spot #2: [[AEGIS Remote Shield]], [[Exp. Powered Armor]], [[Hvy. Regenerative Plating]], or [[Med. Regenerative Plating]]|Item spots #3/4: [[Hyp. EM Gauss Rifle]], [[Potential Cannon]], [[Tachyon Dispersion Ray]], or [[Warp Cannon]]|Item tucked into bottom right wall: [[Gui. Remote Datajack]][[/List]]
There is also a hidden chamber at the bottom of the map. Accessing it requires digging through the wall which will result in a scan. Inside is a machine that contains the [[LC Capacitor]].
[[Heading:2]]Special Machines[[/Heading]]
Not counting the entrance Terminal, there are 3 unique interactible Terminals on this map. They will only be understandable if the Data Conduit has been used this run, otherwise they will just be garbled text. The Active System Cloaker machine on the right has some lore records and will summon a squad of [[Grunt|Grunts]] when destroyed. The A0 Command machine on the left only has lore records. Some of these records can only be unlocked if certain gameplay actions were performed this game. The hidden Storage 04-B machine has some lore records explaining the LC Capacitor and has a hack that will drop the Capacitor on the ground where it can be used.
[[Heading]]Unlockable Lab Orders[[/Heading]]
While most of the Lab Orders in the A0 Command machine are available all of the time, there are a few that have special conditions to achieve:
[[List]]Order 6-0321: Destroy the [[Cetus]] Manufacturing Module machine|Order 6-0323: [[Warlord]] must be destroyed in his [[Warlord (Location)|base]]. Cogmind does not need to be the one to destroy Warlord or attack him at all.|Order 6-0324: Warlord must be met in his base, survive, and plan to attack -2 [[Research]][[/List]]"

Materials,Location,"Materials is the first real level of the game. These maps are small, cramped and have few paths forward. This is the first map with hostile [[0b10]] patrols hanging around, comprised mainly of low level [[G-34 Mercenary]] and [[G-47 Trooper]] grunts and [[S-10 Pest]] swarmers. There are also a few special special mechanics such as [[U-05 Engineer|Engineers]] not calling for reinforcements when attacked while trying to build structures in -10 and -9 and [[A-02 Transporter|Haulers]] not calling for reinforcements at all.
Trying to play flight or hover is not easy in Materials due to many forced encounters with combat robots, little room for maneuvering and few slots yet available for good utilities. The usual recommended way to play these maps is to grab some legs or treads and start blasting. Most players prefer not to transfer to airborne propulsion until [[Factory]] where it is much easier to stealth around and avoid combat. In Materials, it's good to fight enemies one at a time by leading them to one of the many doorways around the map. Use of launchers is very effective whenever there is more than a single bot grouped up close.
[[Alert]] is not a big issue in these maps because of the relatively small map size and number of total patrols. If making a mess of the floors on -10 and -9, entering the [[Mines]] is a good way to lose all of the alert gained from the early Materials maps.
Full list of depth-specific mechanics that apply in Materials:
[[List]]-9: [[Y-45 Defender|Sentries]] start to appear on the map|-9: [[Assault Squad|Assaults]] will start to be summoned above Alert level 2|-9: [[Scanalyzer|Scanalyzers]] begin to appear on the map|-8: [[U-05 Engineer|Engineers]] begin to summon reinforcements when attacked while rebuilding|-8: [[H-71 Marshal|Heavies]] begin to appear on the map|-8: [[Garrison Machine|Garrisons]] begin to appear on the map[[/List]]

Storage Unit|Small]], [[Med. Storage Unit|Medium]], and [[Lrg. Storage Unit|Large]] storage units[[/Gallery]]The storage cache prefab can be very important early on in the game. Cogmind only starts with a [[Sml. Storage Unit]] with very little room for important backup parts and should upgrade ASAP. While not guaranteed, these storage caches will appear on almost every Materials map. [[Hcp. Storage Unit]] and [[Huge Storage Unit]] can both be commonly found on the floor in these maps, but they are not included in the standard storage cache prefab.
The other important cache is the out-of-depth parts cache. These caches contain 3 groups of 4 parts that will be one rating out of depth and can include prototypes. For example, on -9 Materials the standard highest rating part is a 2, while the cache will contain rating 3 or 3* [[Prototype Parts]]. This is one of the best ways to become very strong in Materials. For example, getting a stockpile of [[Enh. Autogun|Enh. Autoguns]] on -9 can help set a combat up for multiple floors to come.[[Heading:2]]Exits[[/Heading]]There are 3 types of normal exits in Materials:[[List]]Main access exits: These always lead to the next main floor, either Materials or [[Factory]]. These exits can be recognized by their distinctive 3 tile corridor leading to a dead-end exit along the edges of the map. There are always 3 of these per Materials map.|[[Mines]] exits: These exits are almost always distinguishable by a few specific prefabs of some machinery and a cache of items. Occasionally Mines exits will spawn without the prefab and look like standard exits.

Mines,Location,"Mines is the first [[Branch]] of the game and is guaranteed to appear on -10 and -9 of [[Materials]] in every game. These maps have several unique early-game rewards that can pay off throughout the whole run, but also has some very dangerous events. The assembled infestation event is a common cause of early death in runs. Aside from the events, the map is sparsely populated with early game patrols of [[G-34 Mercenary]] and [[G-47 Trooper]] grunts and [[S-10 Pest]] swarmers. Several types of friendly and occasionally hostile Derelicts can also be found here. [[Derelict Log|Derelict Logs]] and [[Scrap]] can be found randomly on the ground.

The 3 different types of Derelict shop events are all great events to get. The out-of-depth parts will usually provide an immediate buff and the early [[Imp. Trap Extractor]] can be very strong for anybody who wants to use a lot of [[Traps]]. The drone bay shop gives one of the following unique parts that aren't accessible anywhere else:[[List]][[Bomb Drone Bay]]|[[Decoy Drone Bay]]|[[Sensor Drone Bay]]|[[Splice Drone Bay]]|[[Thief Drone Bay]][[/List]]

This will be accompanied with the Log text [[GameText]]No threat detected, you may enter[[/GameText]]. The Exiles exit will only be on one of the two Mines depths. The following Log message will be shown when entering the Mines map with the exit: [[GameText]]Something is scanning the area.[[/GameText]]|[[Spoiler:Spoiler]][[Zion]] shortcut: A event with a friendly Derelict will create an exit leading to Zion. This will always skip a depth to -7 and is only available on -8 Mines after exiting a -9 Exiles map.[[/Spoiler]][[/List]][[Heading]]Events[[/Heading]]
There are a mix of friendly and hostile events that can occur in the Mines. While the friendly events can be very nice, some of the bad ones can easily be run-ending.

A few Assembled will also show up buried in the walls. Squads of [[T-07 Excavator|Tunnelers]] guarded by [[G-34 Mercenary|Grunts]] will be dispatched continuously every several hundred turns to dig out the collapsed tiles. Using a digging tool like a [[Mining Laser]] or [[Mining Claw]] is recommended to escape quicker.|(--) Assembled invasion: A large number of Assembled will appear and start attacking everything nearby. An [[C-30 ARC|ARC]] containing 2 [[D-53 Grenadier|Demolishers]] will be dispatched from the closest Materials exit and sent to the initial spawn location. A [[Guerrilla (5)|Derelict]] will appear next to you and tell you to run away as they provide a distraction. This event is extremly dangerous so early in the game as both the Assembled and Demolishers can deal a lot of damage very quickly. A launcher is highly recommended for dealing with the Assembled, while strong single-target weapons like kinetic cannons are ideal for dealing with the Demolishers. Getting stuck between them both is the worst case scenario and stripping to core and running is sometimes the only option to survive. A good tactic to avoid combat is to try to dig into the walls using a digging tool like a [[Mining Laser]] or [[Mining Claw]] and hide out of sight for a few hundred turns. Usually, most of the Assembled and Demolishers end up destroying each other.[[/List]]"

Recycling,Location,"Recycling is an early game [[0b10]]-controlled [[Branch]] with no hostile combat bots that is accessible only from [[Storage]]. The only 2 ways to enter this branch are by using the \\IAMDERELICT code at the Recycling exit in Storage or by entering a Storage [[Garrison Machine|Garrisons]] and looping back into this floor instead of proceeding to the next depth. While there are no combat bots on this map, there are very large numbers of [[N-01 Spotter|Spotters]] that will scan Cogmind and report an oncoming threat. This adds 15 influence per Spotter, but that is not the real concern. The [[Alert]] on the following map will skyrocket after getting scanned many times and will usually contribute 900 influence. That puts a Cogmind with 0 influence exiting Recycling at alert level 3-N when entering the next map. Because of this, finding a way to purge alert via hacking or exiting into a [[Caves]] branch is highly recommended after visiting Recycling. Recycling is also unique in that is forces a skipped depth. For example, entering a Storage map on -8 leads to a Recycling map on -8 that leads to a [[Factory]] map on -6 rather than -7 like most branches.
For all its faults, this map does have some unique benefits. Because there are no combat reinforcements of any kind, there are few downsides to getting traced at all of the [[Terminal|Terminals]] and [[Recycling Machine|Recycling Machines]]. There are a large number of Recycling Machines on this map and using Force(Tunnel) on all of them can be very helpful in uncovering the depths of many maps in the floors above. There are commonly a large number of [[Corrupted Parts|Corrupted]] Authchips]] available for players who want to do a lot of [[Fabricator|Fabrication]].
[[Heading]]Prefabs[[/Heading]]

Compared to many other branches, the Recycling prefabs tend to be very lackluster. The large collection of Authchips is the main unique reward for coming to this branch, although this is not a guaranteed reward. It is possible to ammass a large army of rewired bots, although they all spawn fairly damaged. A large army is also not strongly advised because they will run amok trying to chase after the spotters that run away after being shot at. They also do not help with the Alert issues that are already caused by visiting this map. Other than that, the parts on the ground and in the [[Recycling Machine|Recycling Machines]] tend to be reasonably damaged and low rating and are not very exciting.
[[Heading:2]]Exits[[/Heading]]
There is only one type of exit in Recycling and it is a main access exit that will always lead to the [[Factory]] map that is 2 floors above the current depth.
[[Image]]Recycling Warlord Attack.png|Derelicts attacking Recycling[[/Image]]
[[Heading]]Events[[/Heading]]
There is a rare Recycling event where the floor is stormed by white colored friendly but uncontrollable [[Warlord]]-aligned Derelicts. They will beeline toward the exit, stopping only to shoot any [[N-01 Spotter|Spotters]] they encounter. On exiting the floor, a few squads of the Warlord bots will also spawn on the next map and roam around."

Research,Location,"Research is a [[0b10]]-controlled main floor that appears on both -3 and -2. Research maps continue to amp up the difficulty in strength and number of general combat encounters, hacking difficulty, and difficulty in locating exits. Compared to the previous [[Factory]] floors, Research maps are just as big, but are much more maze-like with large numbers of smaller interconnected rooms and big sections of the level entirely disconnected by large chunks of earth. Exploring all of these different rooms is more difficult than before, and finding an exit can be a real challenge.
Unlike factory floors with [[Caves]] available, there are usually no easy exits to dissipate [[Alert]] in Research. The natural alert dissipation that occurs between levels continues to decrease. Purging alert or avoiding it in the first place can be a big deal if the player is not prepared to fight off [[High Security]]. [[Infowar]] continues to be important to avoid unnecessary encounters whenever possible, and [[Hackware]] should be used to purge alert and locate exits whenever possible.
As the difficulty increases, the rewards do to match. Many powerful unique parts can be found in Research specific branches [[Testing]] and [[Quarantine]]. There are also more [[Prototype Parts|Prototypes]] lying around on the floor. Using a [[Component Analysis Suites|Component Analysis Suite]] can pay off to avoid attaching faulty prototypes.
A big change in Research is the final upgrade of Programmers. The 1-2 [[P-70 Sage|Sages]] per [[Extermination Squad|Extermination]] get upgraded to being 2-3 [[P-80 Master|Masters]]. The extra Programmer on average, higher core integrity, and higher damage output make them a serious threat to prepare for. Many builds will live or die based on how well they can handle Exterminations. Look for a way to kill in a single core shot, like using a [[Enh. Nova Cannon]]. Airborne builds can instead make use of recall hacks or get spotted and run away to avoid direct combat.
Other important Research level bot upgrades are [[Heavy|Heavies]] and [[Hunter|Hunters]] upgrading to their highest tier on -2. The [[H-81 Overseer]] deals a frightening 91 damage per volley, becomes even tougher to kill, and gains a visual upgrade to 22 tiles which is further than the telltale 20 tile range of the [[Active Sensor Suite]]. The [[H-88 Terminator]] is also a very formidable opponent. The scary changes here are the upgrade from an [[Imp. Phase Shifter]] to an [[Adv. Phase Shifter]] which makes them even more difficult to hit, and the Scan Cloak (4) trait which makes them invisible on [[Sensor Arrays]] unless using an [[Exp. Signal Interpreter]]. If fighting them head on, using [[Launchers]] to aim indirectly or Treads with [[Siege Mode]] can help a lot.

[[Heading:2]]Exits[[/Heading]]
There are 4 types of main exits on Research floors. Most of them can't be identified via look alone:
[[List]]Main access exits: These always lead to the next main floor, either Research or [[Access]]. These can sometimes be identifiable by a 4 tile wide corridor that leads into a dead end with the exit in the middle. Otherwise, any non-prefab exit could be a main access exit. [[Signal Interpreters]] or [[Terminal]] access hacks are the main ways to identify these types of exits. There will always be 3 of these exits per map.|[[Spoiler:Spoiler]][[Quarantine]] exit: This is the only other type of exit that can be identified. Quarantine exits can sometimes be identified when they appear as a prefab with several locked or unlocked rows of blast doors. There are also otherwise unremarkable exits that can also lead to Quarantine. These exits will always be on the floor that there are no Testing exits on. There will always be 2 exits on the same depth that Quarantine is on.[[/Spoiler]]|[[Spoiler:Spoiler]][[Testing]] exit: These exits are always indistinguishable from any other type of exit. There will always be 2 exits on the same depth that Testing is on.[[/Spoiler]]|[[Spoiler:Spoiler]][[Armory]] exit: These exits are alwayd indistinguishable from any other type of exit. There will only be 1 exit on the depth that Armory is on.[[/Spoiler]][[/List]]
One other type of additional exit is the [[DSF]]. These exits continue on from Factory and have the same auto-lock on hostile sight behavior. Getting inside is difficult.
[[Heading]]Events[[/Heading]]
[[Spoiler:Spoiler]]There are 2 major Research-specific events. Both of these events can only be triggered by previous interactions Cogmind have had in [[Branch|branches]] and have major effects on the maps that they occur on:
[[Heading:2]]-3 [[Revision 17]] invasion[[/Heading]]
[[Image]]Research Revisions.png|Revision 17++ with Revision allies[[/Image]]
[[Image]]Research Suppression Forces.png|Suppression forces dispatched to fight the Revisions[[/Image]]
If Revision 17 is rescued in [[Cetus]] and the Cetus Manufacturing Module machine survives, they will show up in a new form as [[Revision 17++]] and lead a group of 4 [[Revision|Revisions]] to follow Cogmind. They are uncontrollable allies but do not generate any alert for Cogmind when attacking. 200 turns after entering the level, the announcements [[GameText]]Unknown forces entering zones 8R, 1R, 4T. Local Systems Malfunctioning.[[/GameText]] Squads of 4 Revisions will continue to appear from main access exits every 200 turns. Occasionally a Revision will shout [[GameText]]Recycler![[/GameText]] and turn hostile, although this may also be followed by [[GameText]]##MEMORY:RESET##[[/GameText]] to turn them friendly again. 500 turns after Revision 17 arrives, an alert [[GameText]]Research terminal network lockdown[[/GameText]] will appear, and all Terminals on the map will shut down. Another alert will show up 50 turns later: [[GameText]]Suppression forces dispatched. All non-combat units evacuate.[[/GameText]] After this message, squads of 2 [[Executioner|Executioners]] or [[Striker|Strikers]] and an [[C-30 ARC|ARC]] will start to appear from exits and roam the map, looking for hostiles. They will also spawn every 200 turns.
There are a few other side-effects of this event. One is that explosive machines will explode at random whenever Cogmind is nearby. This can be good when fighting enemies around explosive machines, but be wary of them when walking around the map or else they may surprise you at a bad time. Another is that mapgen is affected. [[Heavy|Heavies]] will not appear on a map that Revision 17 invades.
This event can be a great blessing or a curse depending on a lot of factors. Getting an escort of alert-free allies with other squads of allies roaming the map is great. They will clean up most of the map for you and can net some free prototype bot loot. Blocking Heavy spawns is incredibly useful here as well. The downsides can also be pretty major, however. Losing access to all Terminals by turn 500 can be very bad if Cogmind is on slow propulsion and has no exit intel and no form of terrain scanning. Trying to  follow the spawning Revisions or suppression forces can lead to an exit, although it can be a bit unreliable. Another downside is that the Revisions will often create a ton of squads to appear right at the beginning of the event. Sometimes, large groups of [[Operator|Operators]] and alarm traps can all be triggered at nearly the same time. This can result in massive groups of hostiles to appear right in Cogmind's face with unlucky exit or garrison positioning.
[[Heading:2]]-2 [[Warlord]] invasion[[/Heading]]
[[Image]]Research Warlord Entrance.png|Warlord making an entrance with friends[[/Image]]
if Warlord is aligned with in his [[Warlord (Location)|base]], he will bring huge groups of [[Derelict]] forces to attack Research. The event will begin with the alert [[GameText]]ALERT: Engineering response network critical failure, offline[[/GameText]]. More announcements will show up, but the next most important one will be [[GameText]]Warlord currently on norther/central/southern western approach. All unnits hit designated targets[[/GameText]] which indicates where Warlord and [[God Mode]] will appear on the map. 50 turns after entering the map, another announcement [[GameText]]Trap arrays successfully disabled[[/GameText]] will come with all traps being removed from the map. 110 after entering the maps, [[GameText]]Machine network successfully disabled[[/GameText]] will indicate that every machine on the map is now shut down except for [[Garrison Machine|Garrisons]] due to the follow-up message [[GameText]]Unrecognized interference restored garrison access controls. Oops. Just blast them.[[/GameText]] 250 turns after entering the map and every 150 turns after that, 3 different assault squad spawns will appear from garrisons and map exits with the message [[GameText]]Unaware assault squad dispatched in northeast/southeast/southwest/northwest quadrant.[[/GameText]] The spawn location will be indicated on the map. Every 100 turns 1 Derelict squad will spawn on the left side of the map for each tunnel. After 1000 turns on the map, Warlord will tell Cogmind that it is time to retreat and to open the [[Spoiler:Redacted]]Cave Seals in [[Command]] for the final push.[[/Spoiler]]
[[Image]]Research Warlord Squads.png|A few Derelict squads[[/Image]]
The Derelict forces consist of many unique bots during this event. All of them appear as non-controllable allies that do not generate any alert for Cogmind. There are 3 spawn points in the form of giant tunnels. Each tunnel is dug out by a [[Borebot]] escorted by 2 [[Samaritan|Samaritans]]. They will dig straight across the map to the right side. Tiles that are dug out by Borebots are safe to travel on and will not cave-in. Warlord attack squads can vary greatly in composition but are made up of the following bots:
[[List]][[Butcher (7)|Butchers]]|[[Commander|Commanders]]|[[Dragon|Dragons]]|[[Fireman (7)|Firemen]]|[[Guerrilla (7)|Guerrillas]]|[[Hydra|Hydras]]|[[Knight]]|[[Marauder (8)|Marauders]]|[[Martyr (7)|Martyrs]]|[[Savage (7)|Savages]]|[[Thug (7)|Thugs]]|[[Troll|Trolls]]|[[Wasp (7)|Wasps]]|[[Wizard (7)|Wizards]][[/List]]
[[Image]]Research Warlord Assault Squads.png|0b10 Warlord response assault squad[[/Image]]The 0b10 forces come in groups of 3 bots. There are always 2 (not necessarily of the same type) of [[Executioner]], [[Striker]], and [[D-83 Annihilator]] bots along with a [[C-30 ARC|ARC]] full of bots. They roam around the map looking for bots to fight.
This event tends to be great for Cogmind. The primary downsides is that the machine network turns off relatively early into the event and locating the desired exit can be a pain. Getting stuck in a bad position without any Derelict allies can also be painful since the assaults, particularly the prototype bots and demolishers, pack quite a punch. However, the large number of alert-free allies and free loot from the bots fighting is great to any build. Like the Revision 17 event, this event will also cause the maps to have no Heavies. Finding any exit is usually possible by following the assault dispatch notifications. Assaults will be dispatched out of any Garrison or exit. The only exits that assaults do not come from are Quarantine prefab exits. In that case, using other infowar like terrain scanning and drones is the best way to locate these exits.[[/Spoiler]]"

Storage,Location,"Storage is an early game [[0b10]]-controlled [[Branch]] with no unique rewards but plenty of good prototype parts. Storage maps tend to be fairly cramped just like [[Materials]] maps but with fewer patrols and many more [[Y-45 Defender|Sentries]] guarding individual rooms and corridors. There is an unusually high number of [[A-02 Transporter|Haulers]] in these maps. Destroying them for their loot is highly recommended on -9 and -8. On -7 however, many of the Haulers will begin summoning [[Reinforcement Squad|Reinforcements]] that can cause trouble. The majority of the [[Prototype Parts]] at this point in the game will be weapons or flight units, so players trying to prepare for a flight transition should consider visiting Storage on -9 or -8. Combat players should also consider Storage as a good way to stock up on early game weaponry. -7 Storage is considered generally inferior to [[Caves]] because Caves has the advnate of [[Alert]] reduction as well as unique branch rewards.
Storage is notable for the large number of prototype parts available. Unique shell and vaults contain many useful early game loot. Vaults can also contain out-of-depth parts. Storage is also notable for the mostly guaranteed [[Garrison Machine|Garrison]]. It is the only way to enter a Garrison on -9.

All of the special loot in Storage comes in the form of vaults and shells. The shells will only contain standard floor rating non-prototype and prorotype parts. However, some of the vaults contain very out of depth prototype parts. The single item locked vault and the vault full of traps can contain rating 5* prototypes that are far out of depth compared to the normal Storage depths. These vaults can contain great items like [[Cld. Plasma Cannon]], [[Exp. Targeting Computer]], and even a semi-unique part [[Lgt. Regenerative Plating]]. Shells must be broke open by a weapon, while vaults must be hacked open via [[Terminal]]. Some vaults will already be open on entering the map.
[[Heading:2]]Exits[[/Heading]]
There are 2 types of exits in Storage:
[[List]]Main access exits: These always lead to the next main floor, either [[Materials]] or [[Factory]].

Testing,Location,"Testing is a [[0b10]]-controlled [[Branch]] off of [[Research]] that appears on either -3 or -2. It is always on the floor that [[Testing]] is not on. Testing is a much smaller and generally much more manageable map compared to normal Research floors. There are few patrols, no [[Sentry]] or [[Heavy]] guards, and only a few special mini guard areas that can usually be easily avoided. There are unique [[Researcher]] bots that show up on this map that have dangerous effects when getting scanned. There are also powerful special and unique items that are not obtainable anywhere else. Even among normal parts, there is a much higher than usual chance of finding [[Prototype Parts]] on the ground.
Testing is home to the [[SGEMP Prototype]] that [[Zhirov]] asks for when you see him in his [[Zhirov (Location)|lab]]. It is guarded by 2 [[Striker|Strikers]] and an [[Alpha 7]]. The SGEMP always spawns in the vertically opposite corner of the map that Cogmind first spawns on. For example, if Cogmind would spawn in the top-left section of the map, the SGEMP would be in the bottom left. With the [[Phasing AFG]] and [[Portable AFG]], it is possible to retrieve the SGEMP without getting spotted at all. Otherwise the primary methods of obtaining are fighting the bots head-on or grabbing it and making a run for it.
[[Heading:2]]Getting Scanned[[/Heading]]
Attacking when in visual range of a Researcher or attacking a Researcher will result in them turning yellow and attempting to stasis and scan any hostiles. Whenever any bot is caught in stasis, the Researcher will summon a [[Reinforcement Squad]] to its current position. If Cogmind is scanned, it will also result in [[Q-Series]] being summoned instead of [[Extermination Squad|Exterminations]]. These Q-Series have custom loadout that depends on Cogmind's current build.
Typically getting scanned is seen as a negative due to the high power level of Q-Series. Some builds might intentionally want to get scanned in order to get the Q-Series loot. To avoid unintentionally scanning, detach any ranged weapons whenever a Researcher is in line of sight of Cogmind. Melee weapons, special weapons like [[Datajacks]], and any type of guided weapon are safe to keep equipped to avoid misfires due to [[Corruption]].

[[Heading:2]]Protovariants[[/Heading]]
There can be up to 2 Protovariants on a Testing map. These are prototype superpowered versions of different bot classes that have a very strong loadout of high rating prototype parts. They are fearsome foes with high damage output and are quite difficult to take down compared to most bots but have incredible loot. They can spawn in one of 4 states: Unpowered, Dormant, Active, or Disabled/rewirable. Protovariants can be of the following types:
[[List]][[Protovariant D]]: Demolisher|[[Protovariant G]]: Grunt|[[Protovariant H]]: Hunter|[[Protovariant L]] Duelist|[[Protovariant P]]: Programmer|[[Protovariant X]]: Specialist|[[Protovariant Y]]: Sentry[[/List]]
In Testing there is a special hack that can appear on [[Terminal|Terminals]]: [[GameText]]Control(Protovariants)[[/GameText]]. If successfully performed, it will turn a Protovariant on the map hostile to everything. The Protovariant can make quite a mess of 0b10 bots, but may cause more trouble than it's worth. Researchers will report the bot repeatedly when they see it attack. Additionally, there is a special assault [[C-30 ARC|ARC]] that gets dispatched to the Protovariant's location. This ARC contains an [[Investigator]] inside that will scan Cogmind even without being provoked.
[[Heading:2]]Testing Shells[[/Heading]]
The majority of unique Testing items appear in Reinforced Shells. There are no identifying features that indicate the contents of these Shells. The list of unique Testing items contained within are:
[[List]][[2N-1CE's Frost Array]]|[[AEGIS Remote Shield]]|[[Cld. Nova Cannon]]|[[Disintegrator]]|[[Exp. Hardlight Generator]]|[[Ghost Barrier]]|[[Hpw. Disruptor Cannon]]|[[Hvy. Quantum Rifle]]|[[Hyp.

Multirail]]|[[Myomer Exoskeleton]]|[[Null Cannon]]|[[Omega Cannon]]|[[Perforator]]|[[Portable AFG]]|[[System Mapper]]|[[Tachyon Dispersion Ray]]|[[Warp Gun]]|[[Z-bomb Delivery System]][[/List]]
There are 2 unique prefabs that do not contain any of the above items and have their own list. One prefab has 1-2 [[Potential Cannon|Potential Cannons]] or [[Imp. Potential Cannon|Imp. Potential Cannons]] (not necessarily the same type) and several [[Imp. Energy Well|Imp]], [[Adv. Energy Well|Adv]], or [[Exp. Energy Well|Exp. Energy Wells]]. The other shell is locked behind Sealed Heavy Doors and has a special Researcher behind. The Terminal can be hacked to open the doors, but the Researcher will make it difficult to break the Shell without getting scanned. However, penetrating the heavy doors first will allow safely killing the Researcher. It is also possible to dig in to the back of the prefab directly into the Shell area. The shell will always contain [[SHELL Armor]] and 3 random pieces of [[Lgt. Regenerative Plating]], [[Med. Regenerative Plating]], or [[Hvy. Regenerative Plating]]. The Terminal on the inside of the shell contains schematic for some of the regenerative platings.
[[Heading:2]]Exits[[/Heading]]
There is always 1, and possibly 2 exits in Testing:
[[List]]Main access exit: There will always be 1 exit that leads to the next main Research or [[Access]] floor. It will always be at a dead end for a 4 tile corridor.|[[Spoiler:Redacted]][[Section 7]] exit: This exit only appears some of the time. [[Quarantine]] must have been first on the world map, so this exit can only show up when Testing is on -2. A large 4 tile doorway will show up on the middle of the map, on the right side of where the map typically ends. It will open up into a 6 tile hallway and a [[Fortress]] will be guarding the path to the exit.[[/Spoiler]][[/List]]"

[[Heading]] Tips [[/Heading]]
Most jammers have short range, so attention needed to keep enemies in range. [[Watcher]] and [[Heavy]] bots require special attention due to their big visual range.
Significantly decreases chances of small confrontation snowballing into big fight.
Limits consequences of mistakes during stealth, if you can deal with bot that spotted you. Gives significantly more freedom to stealth builds able to take on small groups of enemies.
If you can destroy [[Extermination Squad|extermination squad's]] leader without the rest of the squad seeing you, they might wander away.
Jammers allow you to force 1-v-1 fights via [[Line of Sight|LoS]] manipulation. Works best versus stationary bots like [[Caves|caves outposts]]. Alternatively, good jammer paired with strong [[Cloaking Devices|cloaking device]] or [[Exp. Transmission Jammer]] on it's own allow forcing 1-v-1 fighting by surpassing enemy's visual range."

Warlord (Location),Location,"The Warlord base is a [[Caves]] [[Branch]] that appears on -5 or -4 and is named after the eponymous bot [[Warlord]]. This map is home to a large number of [[Derelict|Derelicts]] allied with Warlord and ready to fight. This branch is much more combat-oriented than many of the other Caves branches, with large waves of [[0b10]] bots assaulting the base. Initially the map is totally safe and filled with friendly NPCs, but after one of several conditions is met a large assault will begin.
The right side of the map is the same every run. There is a small cave-like area with an exit just above the starting area. There are a few [[Dirty Bomb Trap|Dirty Bomb Traps]] spread around this section of the map, so be prepared if Cogmind has any [[Corruption]]. There are two entrances into the base: The first has some doors blocking a large corruption-cleansing System Quarantine Field Array, some opened Blast Doors, and a second set of regular doors opening up into 2 [[Marauder (6)|Marauders]]. This entrance has a large number of [[Fire Trap|Fire Traps]] installed. The second way in is either on the top or the bottom of the map, hidden behind some fake walls. These will automatically open if approached from the inside of the base. Behind these fake walls are a set of Sealed Heavy Doors, followed by one more set of fake walls. If Cogmind is [[RIF]] aligned, they will be detected and the entire base will be turned hostile. This occurs no matter which entrance is taken. It is safe to get the corruption cleanse, but any further will be dangerous.
The interior of the base is different every run. There are always 2 guaranteed rooms in every run. The first is the Vortex Lab which is locked behind Sealed Heavy Doors with a [[Terminal]] to open it next to them. Inside are some [[Tinkerer|Tinkerers]], a lore Terminal, and a random assortment of Vortex weaponry. There will always be at least one pair of weapons from the following list:
[[List]][[Vortex Cannon]]|[[Vortex Driver]]|[[Vortex Lance]]|[[Vortex Rail]]|[[Vortex Rifle]]|[[Vortex Shotgun]][[/List]]
There may also be a single [[Vortex Catalyst Activator]], and if this is a seed where the [[Exiles]] abandoned their hideout, [[EX-BIN]] will be present along with a [[BFG-9k Vortex Edition]]. The other guaranteed room is Warlord's throne room. In it are Warlord himself, 6 [[Thug (7)|Thugs]], 2 [[Knight|Knights]], [[God Mode (Fake)|Fake God Mode]], and Warlord's stash. The stash is locked by Sealed Heavy Doors. The Terminal can be hacked open with a special code obtained at a Terminal in [[Data Miner (Location)]].
The contents of Warlord's stash will vary every game with only the Vortex Chain Reactor being guaranteed. The contents can be as follows:
[[List]](guaranteed) [[Vortex Chain Reactor]]|[[Adv. Remote Shield]] or [[Imp. Energy Mantle]]|[[Exp. Phase Shifter]], [[Exp. Targeting Computer]], or [[Exp. Cloaking Device]]|1-2 of one of [[Electron Diverter]], [[Imp. Diametric Drive]], or [[Cld. Impulse Thruster]]|1-2 of one of [[Exp. Myomer Leg]] or [[Enh. Biometal Leg]]|1-2 of one of [[Cld.

[[Heading]]Alignment[[/Heading]]
After entering Warlord's throne room, he will explain his plan to attack upper 0b10. As long as he survives before Cogmind leaves the map, he will attack on -2 [[Research]]. This will occur even if you turn the Warlord forces hostile before exiting the map. Along with this Research event, there is another event in [[Command]] that this affects: [[Spoiler:Redacted]]When the Command cave seals are opened, [[Warlord (Command)]] will pop out along with various other Warlord-aligned Derelicts.[[/Spoiler]] This alignment is incompatible with RIF as Warlord will be hostile when entering the base. It is also incompatible with [[Imprint]] because Warlord will be disappointed in Cogmind.

[[Heading]]0b10 Assault[[/Heading]]
There are several conditions that can kick off the 0b10 assault on Warlord's base:
[[List]]Moving 575 tiles|Being on the map for 1300 turns|Visiting Warlord in his throne room|Opening up the Vortex Lab[[/List]]
After any of these conditions is met, large groups of 0b10 forces will come from an opening in either the top-right, middle-right, or bottom-right section of the map. These bots roam around the map randomly in groups, but usually come straight through the main entrance. When this happens, a large group of [[Bouncer|Bouncers]] will join the existing Marauder guards at the front gate. The first wave will usually be decimated by the entryway traps, but many more will follow.
There are a total of 14 assault waves, although it is highly recommended to leave the map before that many enemy bots appear. 10 turns after the first [[GameText]]MAIN.C incursion imminent. Mobilizing sentries[[/GameText]] announcement, the first wave will appear with the announcement [[GameText]]Northeast/Southeast/Central east cave walls breached[[/GameText]] indicating where the spawn location is. From then on, waves will spawn in 100 turn increments. Every 90 turns will give a [[GameText]]MAIN.C reinforcements approaching through caves, arriving soon[[/GameText]] announcement, and 10 turns after that the waves will spawn with an announcement of the wave composition. 4 squads can spawn per wave.
[[Image]]Warlord Assault Wave.png|A typical assault wave. Pictured are Saboteur, Hunter, Melee, and Grunt squads with Prototype support[[/Image]]
[[Heading:2]]Assault Contents[[/Heading]]
The hostile forces are made up of different types of squads, each with their own squad leader:
[[List]]Behemoth Squad: [[Behemoth|Behemoths]]|Demolisher Squad: [[Demolisher|Demolishers]] with a [[Protector]]|Grunt Squad: [[Grunt|Grunts]], sometimes with a [[Specialist]] squad leader or [[Protector]] support|Hunter Squad: [[Hunter|Hunters]] and [[Swarmer|Swarmers]]|Melee Squad: [[Duelist|Duelists]], [[Brawler|Brawlers]] with a [[Protector]]|Mixed Squad: [[Grunt|Grunts]], [[Duelist|Duelists]], [[Brawler|Brawlers]], and [[Mechanic|Mechanics]]|Programmer Squad: [[Programmer|Programmers]]|Saboteur Squad: [[E-15 Imp|Imps]] and [[Grunt|Grunts]]|Swarmer Squad: [[Swarmer|Swarmers]][[/List]]
Sometimes these squads can spawn with ""Prototype Support"". When this happens, [[Executioner]] and [[Striker]] bots can also appear as part of a squad.
[[Heading:2]]Assisting[[/Heading]]Destroying the doors in the entryway can be a good idea to allow the Bouncers and Marauders to pick hostiles off one-by-one as they enter visual range. This is ideally done before triggering the assault in the first place. Melee weapons are a safe way to do this, otherwise you may run the risk of missing into a friendly Derelict that will become not-so-friendly in a hurry.
[[Image]]Warlord Wall Lure.png|Luring hostiles around the wall[[/Image]]Staying and fighting near the main entryway is one of the best approaches to fighting the waves off. Join in with [[Launchers]] if you have them, but make sure to watch out for friendly fire. There is a bit of leeway, but hitting allies too many times will be considered a betrayal. Demolishers and Programmers are the highest priority targets since they can cause a lot of damage with Launchers and robot hacking respectively. Throwing Claymores and the Vortex Catalyst Activator that can both be obtained on this map are great options to destroy waves with ease. [[Visual Processing Units]] coupled with long ranged weapons are another good option to sit back and snipe bots from outside their typical range. The entrance defense is quite strong and will perform well most of the time. However, a squad of Programmers with an unlucky chain-assimilation of bots or some unchecked Demolishers will quickly tear any defense to pieces.
Even a build with little offensive power can help out in this part of the defense. Getting spotted first will cause hostiles to prioritize Cogmind for a while, even if they are getting shot by something else. This means that the Warlord bots can blast away all the hostiles while they are trying to run after you. This can work well for combat builds too, especially for combat bots without launchers of their own.
[[Heading:2]]Counterattack[[/Heading]]
In between the 4th and 5th waves, a Derelict will appear next to Cogmind to leave the base with the counterattack for cover. At this point, the majority of the combat Derelicts except for the guard Marauders and Bouncers will begin to head outside of the base. The strength of the counterattacks depends on a lot of factors. If the defense falters early on, the counterattack can get caught up fighting a bunch of squads and never make it out the entrance. Their tendency to trickle to the fight can be a big weakness if the hostiles are bunched up and can quickly take out Derelicts one at a time. On the other hand, [[Sapper|Sappers]] will dramatically increase the strength of any counterattack and can destroy big groups of bots on their own. 
The counterattack is usually a good time to exit the map whether it's successful or not. For airborne builds especially, even if the counterattack dies early on it can serve as a good distraction as you fly by.
[[Heading:2]]Base Infiltration[[/Heading]]
[[Image]]Warlord Enhanced Allies.png|Enhanced Allies[[/Image]]In between the 7th and 8th assault waves is the final event of the map. A random spot in the Warlord base will be infiltrated and hostile assault squads will begin to appear from that location too with the announcement [[GameText]]Base interior infiltrated, regroup at designated outer cave rendezvous points[[/GameText]]. At the same time, a friendly group of 3 [[Enhanced Grunt|Enhanced Grunts]] and 3 [[Enhanced Demolisher|Enhanced Demolishers]] will teleport into Warlord's throne room to assist. 2 of the Demolishers will immediately head toward the exit while the remaining bots follow Warlord around. At this point, all surviving Derelicts will head toward Warlord as he makes his way over to the map exit.
This is the last chance to exit the map with any amount of assistance. With assaults pouring in from the main entrance and a spot in the base itself, it is time to go. The Enhanced Demolishers have incredible loot including [[Cmb. Linear Gravjet|Cmb. Linear Gravjets]], [[Centrium Medium Armor Plating]], [[Coolant Network]], and the unique [[Chain Missile Launcher]]. While attacking these bots too much will anger Warlord, sneaking a few [[Plasma Cutter]] hits may be worth the risk for the big rewards."

Wastes,Location,"Wastes is a [[0b10]]-controlled sub-floor in Factory that appears on most floors between -7 and -4. It can only be entered when Cogmind triggers a [[Chute Trap]]. Cogmind will get dropped in instantly, and any nearby allies or bots who have previously triggered a chute trap will also appear over time. Wastes can be a very brutal map for an unprepared player. There are 6 hostile [[C-40 Crusher|Crushers]] that can decimate Cogmind's build in a few hits. There is an EMP that is on in some Wastes maps that fires every 100 turns and adds between 5 to 10% [[Corruption]] to Cogmind. This corruption can be reduced by EM [[Resistance Devices]] and [[Dynamic Insulation Systems]]. There are various broken, faulty, or otherwise low integrity parts scattered on the ground. These parts can be several ratings out of depth and can be good to try to repair or scan and fabricate.
The layout of this map is semi-fixed. The entrance, exits, and general layouts of the map are similar, although the exact layout can vary a bit in which way paths are connected. There are wide 4 tile corridors that sometimes have 8 by 8 tile wide dead ends on the far ends of the map. Cogmind spawns on the left side, and the exit will always be in an 8 by 8 tile section on the right side of the map.

If Cogmind is airborne the strategy is usually pretty simple. Either try to search the big map endings where the Derelict allies spawn from or make a beeline for the exit on the right of the map. The Derelicts will usually take out most of the Crushres without any assistance.If trying to fly by, the Crushers do not have the most intelligent movement and can often be juked by luring them to one side of a corridor and then crossing by the other side out of reach. Circling back may be needed to avoid groups of Crushers. If the EMP is off, Cogmind might be able to kite the Crushers indefinitely in order to shoot them to death with any ranged weapon. Otherwise, the best bet is usually to head straight for the exit to avoid getting too much corruption."

Zhirov (Location),Location,"Zhirov is a [[Caves]] [[Branch]] that appears on -5 or -4 and is home to the eponymous bot [[Zhirov]]. This is a safe map with no hostile spawns and only friendly bots, although Cogmind should be wary of [[Corruption]] triggering misfires that anger Zhirov. Detaching all ranged weapons is advised.
This map initially appears to be a small section of caves with only an exit. Approaching the left wall will cause the cave walls to slide away to reveal some Cloak Generators and some larger Sealed Heavy Doors blocking the way. These Cloak Generators surround the entire outside of Zhirov's lab. Continuing to the left will cause the doors to slide down and reveal Zhirov himself who will greet you. [[Perun]] and [[Svarog]] guard just above and below the entrance on the left side.
There are a large collection of [[Terminal|Terminals]] to the left of Zhirov. The first terminal going counterclockwise contains some lore records and the depths of, [[Quarantine]], [[Testing]], and [[Command]]. The second contains Analyses for [[Q-Series]], [[Striker|Strikers]], [[Executioner|Executioners]], and [[Alpha 7|Alpha 7s]]. The third contains 4 Prototype ID Banks. The fourth contains Schematics for an [[Assault Drone Bay]], [[Exp. Heat Sink]], [[Exp. Optical Array]], and [[Imp. Arc Thrower]]. This is the only way that Assault Drone Bays can be obtained. In the room just below this, there is a series of 3 Terminals that describe Zhirov's past since arriving on Tau Ceti IV.
Near the center area there are two [[Alien Artifact|Alien Artifacts]] with explanatory Terminals. The left will either be an [[Integrated Reactor]] or an [[Integrated Dissipator]]. The right will always be a [[Transdimensional Reconstructor]].
At the bottom of the map are some broken bots and an assorted collection of parts. None of these parts are guaranteed, although there will always be some available. The list of available parts is as follows:
[[List]][[Adv. Myomer Leg]], [[Cld. Gravmag System]], or [[Cld. Nuclear Pulse Thruster]]|[[Fusion Reactor]] or [[Hvy. Antimatter Reactor]]|[[Adv. Energy Well]], or [[Adv. Power Amplifier]]|[[Exp. Core Shielding]], [[Exp. Power Shielding]], [[Exp. Propulsion Shielding]], [[Exp. Utility Shielding]], or [[Exp. Weapon Shielding]]|[[Particle Accelerator]], [[Prc. Matter Filter]], or [[Imp. Matter Compressor]]|[[Adv. System Shield]] or [[Adv. Hacking Suite]][[/List]]
[[Image]]Zhirov Explosion.gif|Zhirov leaving with flair[[/Image]]
Unlike the Cloak Generators in [[Zion]], these machines are the real deal. If destroyed, there are some major consequences that follow. Zhirov and friends will immediately turn aggressive and begin to attack. A large group of friendly [[Enhanced Grunt|Enhanced Grunts]] wil teleport in and start attacking Zhirov. Zhirov will attempt to teleport out when his core integrity gets to about half. He will first say [[GameText]]Looks like we have to say goodbye to this place, and you[[/GameText]]. This will rig a large number of explosions to go off in about 10 turns. This happens even if the Cloak Generators are already intact and Zhirov is attacked.
[[Heading]]Alignment[[/Heading]][[Image]]Testing SGEMP.png|The SGEMP room in Testing[[/Image]]
After entering and exiting the Terminal room, Zhirov will ask Cogmind to steal the [[SGEMP Prototype]] from Testing and bring it to [[Access]]. If done, Zhirov, Perun, and Svarog will show up in Access and will give Cogmind perfect map intel. They will follow Cogmind for a while, although they will all teleport out when Zhirov falls below roughly half core integrity. If a [[Core Reset Matrix]] is used prior to Access but Cogmind still carries the SGEMP, Zhirov and his allies will turn hostile and fight Cogmind to the death. There are no other Alignment incompatabilities with this quest.
There is a second part of this quest that continues in [[Command]]. [[Spoiler:Redacted]]After destroying the first form of [[MAIN.C (Shell)|MAIN.C]] in Command, Zhirov, Perun, and Svarog will show up and attack MAIN.C. Zhirov will activate the Modified SGEMP and disable all 0b10-aligned bots on the map. This also affects [[Warlord (Command)]], but no other Derelicts.[[/Spoiler]]
[[Heading]]Fighting[[/Heading]]
Fighting Zhirov and gaining anything from the encounter is not an easy task. Although he has some nice loot, his tendency to teleport out at the slightest hint of danger and explosive aftermath even on a successful kill is very frustrating to deal with. One option is to loot Perun and Svarog while ignoring Zhirov and simply exiting the map safely. These 2 can still have some good parts, although they have nothing as lucrative as Zhirov with the guaranteed inventory drops of [[Deep Network Scanner]], [[Quantum Router]], and a [[Transdimensional Reconstructor]]. Only Zhirov can set off the traps and cause the group to leave.
The best way to safely grab all the loot is with [[Master Tearclaws]] that can be looted from [[Master Thief|Master Thieves]]. These Tearclaws can strip all 3 bots of their parts with little risk of explosives. Just make sure Zhirov doesn't fall below 80 core integrity. The Tearclaws can even remove the inventory items without requiring Zhirov to actually be killed. The idea is to shoot one of the bots from just outside of one of the rooms and then retreat behind one of the doorways. This will let you safely use the melee Tearclaws while only getting attacked by 1 bot at a time."

Zion,Location,"Zion is a [[Caves]] [[Branch]] that appears on -7 or -6 and is the home to a large number of [[Derelict]] [[Zionite|Zionites]]. It is a general safe haven for all types of Derelict bots and has a ton of lore available by talking with all sorts of Zionites. Similar to Caves, [[Scrap]] and [[Derelict Log|Derelict Logs]] can appear on the ground here. Aside from one relatively harmless event, there are no hostile bots that appear on this map unless Cogmind attacks or attempts to enter while aligned with [[RIF]]. The System Quarantine Field Array at the entrance of the map will cleanse all [[Corruption]]. It is strongly recommended to detach any ranged weapons until cleansing corruption to avoid any misfires that will turn the map hostile. RIF-aligned bots can only go as far as triggering the cleanse, any further will turn Zion hostile.
Zion maps are randomly generated but will always have the same overall appearance. There is a small Caves-like section on the east containing the spawn point and exit to Proximity Caves. To the left is the Quarantine Array machine guarded by 2 friendly [[Marauder (6)|Marauders]]. The bulk of Zion is contained within a large hollow square shape. All of the unique prefabs are contained within this area of the map. To the top left is the locked entrance to the [[Zion Deep Caves]]. Below that is a [[Tinkerer]] next to the Conduit Teleporter, 4 [[Mutant (6)|Mutants]], the [[Imprinter]], and some more Tinkerers next to the Imprinting Machine.
[[Heading]]Alignment[[/Heading]]Walking into the Imprinting machine will allow Cogmind to [[Imprint]] which has some major gameplay effects. The main change is that Cogmind can no longer use normal hacks at [[Terminal|Terminals]] and can now only use a specific set of randomized Zionite hacks. The 4 Mutants that guard the Imprinter will also turn purple and begin to follow you. There is an additional unique effect in [[Command]]: [[Spoiler:Redacted]]When the Command cave seals are opened, powerful Zionite bots will pop out along with various other Zionite-aligned Derelicts. These Zionites will be controllable (blue) rather than purple if a [[Core Reset Matrix]] is used.[[/Spoiler]] This alignment has the following incompatabilities:
[[List]][[Exiles]]/[[Farcom]]: The Imprinter will warn a Farcom-aligned Cogmind against trying to use the machine. If the machine is used anyway, the Zionites will take it as an attack and turn hostile.|RIF: A RIF-aligned Cogmind will turn Zion hostile when attempting to enter in the first place.|[[Revision 17]]: Revision 17 will be afraid of an imprinted Cogmind and will not attack -3 [[Research]].|[[Warlord]]: Warlord will be disappointed in an imprinted Cogmind and will not attack -2 Research.[[/List]]
[[Heading]]Fighting[[/Heading]]
Fighting Zion can be a risky feat for an unprepared Cogmind, but not particularly challenging if going in with a plan. The majority of the [[Zionite|Zionites]] are initially unarmed, although they can scavenge through the Twisted Machinery tiles in order to find several (usually weak) types of guns or melee weapons. Zionites will also appear out of the machinery tiles and instantly attack. This will only happen if Cogmind is within a few tiles of some machinery, so using explosive weaponry on these tiles is highly recommended to avoid unnecessarily fighting extra bots. It is very tedious but possible to use melee to destroy many of these tiles before triggering hostilities to avoid sneak attack possibilities.
One of the largest benefits and threats to fighting Zion is the [[Z-Hero]] spawn. There is a chance that a hostile Hero will spawn at the Caves exit and roam around the map. It is important to have a plan to deal with some of the stronger Heroes like [[99-TNT]] and [[P1-3CE]], even if that plan is only to spot them first and run to avoid getting spotted in return. Other heroes like [[ME-RLN]] are easier to kill. All of them can provide incredibly strong unique loot. Another big reason to fight is the [[Imprinter Data Core]] that will guarantee access to the [[Zion Deep Caves]] if no other methods are available.

There are a wide variety of encounters in Zion. A few are useless, some are more niche, but most are going to have a use in many builds. Every game has a half dozen or so of these encounters available and it is likely that most builds will get something nice out of the trip.
[[Heading:2]]Exits[[/Heading]]
There are 2 types of exits in Zion:[[List]][[Proximity Caves]] exit: This exit is on the top right side of the map near where Cogmind spawns.|[[Zion Deep Caves]] exit: This exit is on the top left side of the map protected by locked blast doors. The doors can be unlocked with a random Derelict event that will provide the hacking codes, unlocked with the hacking codes by obtaining the [[Imprinter Data Core]], or broken into with an Impact or overloadable Thermal cannon like a [[Cld. Particle Cannon]]. The Reinforced Barriers have an armor value of 56 while the Sealed Blast Doors have an armor value of 45 with 0% thermal resistance.[[/List]][[Heading]]Events[[/Heading]]
[[List]](+/-) [[Hunter]] attack: A Hunter disguised as a Derelict will sneak up to the gates of Zion and attack the Marauder guards. This will usually result in the quarantine array being destroyed and the Hunter losing the fight. The dropped parts can be collected by Cogmind but will quickly self-destruct.[[/List]]"
Zion Deep Caves,Location,"The Zion Deep Caves is a [[Branch]] off of [[Zion]] that seems to serve as a sort of base of operations for the [[Imprinter]] and the Zionites. This is a very combat oriented map that requires a lot of preparation to complete entirely. It is possible for a very fast flight build to sneak in, grab one or two things, and escape, but the presence of the prefect-tracking 24 speed [[Z-Imprinter]] makes things tough.
The bulk of the map has a predefined layout except for the right starting point and middle-left exit area which are slightly different every time. These two random areas are mostly empty but can contain small groups of [[Assembled (4)|Assembled]] and a disabled [[Surveybot 24]]. To the left of the starting area are a big Z-Facility machine, a huge explosive Z-Power, and some [[Z-Technician|Z-Technicians]] working on the machine. Above and below are [[Z-Light (5)|Z-Light]] guards. On the top and left side there are Zionite item stashes. To the left side of the exit area is a collection of assorted broken Derelict bots and highly damaged parts. There is an [[Exiles]] item near the top of the area. The far left is an Impregnable Wall which contains a large amount of Assembled and 2 [[Assembler|Assemblers]]. The wall is guarded by a [[Golem]] above and below. There are also some Wall Chambers that drop [[GOLEM Unit|GOLEM Units]] when destroyed. The units will start regrowing into hostile Golems.
While quite challenging, there are some very strong unique rewards on this map. GOLEM units are only available here and can provide a strong build in a-box. [[Asb. Focal Cannon|Focal Cannons]] will tear through most anything in the game quite easily. The [[Asb. Combat Suite]] is a unique part that combines [[Phase Shifters]], [[Targeting Computers]], and [[Core Analyzers]] in a single slot. The [[Surveybot 24 Chip]] is the strongest type of [[Terrain Scan Processors|Terrain Scan Processor]] in the game. [[Zio. Weapon Casing|Weapon Casings]] can protect late-game super-weapons from harm. The [[Zio. Biocell]] is an early way to gain a mostly identical [[Exp. Energy Well]] early in the game.
[[Heading]]Strategy[[/Heading]]
There are some key requirements to deal with each section of this map and common approaches for dealing with each. Here is a general checklist of things that will be useful throughout the map:
[[List]]Propulsion/Weapon/Armor + backups: You will do a lot of fighting in this map. Having backups of these more important parts will keep you alive.|[[Launchers]]: These can be used for the Z-Imprinter, Z-Lights, and especially for the Assembled in the wall. Multiple backups are recommended.|EM weapons: EM is the only effective way to fight Golems. EM traps like [[EM Surge Trap|EM Surge]] or [[Dirty Bomb Trap|Dirty Bombs]] can also be used but having at least 1 EM weapon is best to be safe.|(Optional) [[AS-neutralizer No. 17b]]: Completely neutralizes the threat of the Assembled wall.|(Optional) Allies: Makes the opening Z-Imprinter fight much easier to handle.|(Optional) Dead [[Imprinter]]: Killing the Imprinter in Zion prevents her from showing up in this map. She has no weapons in Zion so taking her out there can be a easy way to skip a big threat on this map.[[/List]]
[[Heading:2]]Starting Area[[/Heading:2]]
There isn't much threat here. There can be groups of 3 Assembled that can be easily dispatched by any weapons, although Launchers are most effective.
[[Image]]ZDC Allies.png|Fighting the Z-Imprinter with allies[[/Image]][[Image]]ZDC Imprinter Launcher.png|Aiming past the Imprinter with a Launcher[[/Image]]
[[Heading:2]][[Z-Imprinter]][[/Heading:2]]
After entering the main open area of the map, the Z-Imprinter will spawn and head directly to Cogmind's location. 2 Z-Lights will follow the Imprinter but are much slower and will take some time to arrive. The Z-Imprinter has high evasion, 150 core integrity, and deals a large amount of damage every volley. Allies are highly recommended for this fight to help destroy her quicker and to draw fire from you. The Derelict ally events from Zion can help, as can the A8 code [[Enhanced Grunt|Enhanced Grunts]]. Use the code on any of the gate terminals on the entrance to this map. A [[Tactical Coordination Suite]] can really help out with a ally damage. [[Targeting Computers]] or 2-slot Treads with [[Siege Mode]] are also recommended to be able to hit the Imprinter more frequently.
For Cogmind's build, any non-EM and non-Impact damage types will work. To get the [[Zio. Metafield Generator]], +Salvage is recommended by using guns with the best available type of [[Salvage Targeting Computers|Salvage Targeting Computer]]. Although it doesn't deal much damage, EM can be used to apply +Salvage if allies are providing enough damage output otherwise. If salvage isn't needed, using Explosive Launchers will be very effective here. Rather than aiming directly at the Imprinter, aim the launcher at a wall or at the end of its range so that the Imprinter is still hit close to the source. This will maintain a high accuracy while still dealing the bulk of the damage to the Imprinter. This technique can also be used against the Z-Lights to good effect.
After the Z-Imprinter is dead, take care that your allies don't spot the Z-Technicians by the Z-Power machine. They will almost assuredly miss into the machine and end up nuking themselves, and if you're not careful, Cogmind. Beware its large 15 tile radius.
[[Heading:2]][[Z-Light]] Guards[[/Heading]]The top and bottom of the map have groups of 3 Z-Light guards. There are 2 groups on the top and one on the bottom. All of these are optional encounters. To avoid them, dig through the center of the Z-Facility and hang near the left side of the area. Enter the tunnel near the top side to avoid getting spotted by the bottom group. The top Z-Lights are often worth fighting because of the large number of special Zionite parts they guard. It is possible to reach the first alcove on the top without getting spotted, but the remainder are all guarded
If Cogmind still has strong allies like Enhanced Grunts alive from the Z-Light encounter, it is possible to just charge in and fight them all at once. They are not as dangerous as the Z-Imprinter, but in large numbers they can still pack a punch. Using Launchers is very effective on these bots since they don't tend to be very tanky as long as you can actually hit them. Using a [[Transmission Jammers|Transmission Jammer]] to lure them 1 at a time can also be an effective strategy if fighting with non-launcher weapons to preserve salvage.
[[Heading:2]]Exit Area[[/Heading]]
Same as the starting area, the only threat here is small groups of 3 Assembled.
[[Heading:2]][[Golem|Golems]][[/Heading]]
Golems are incredibly tanky enemies with an extreme damage output and the source of many lost runs. In order to claim a GOLEM Unit or the exiles item, Cogmind must fight or at least run past them. Conventional weapons do not work at all here. With a 10% core exposure, 200 core integrity, and 15% damage resistance to non-melee damage types, trying to fight fairly is suicide. The best approach is EM damage or Impact. Golems only require an average of 118 damage to corrupt them to death compared to thousands of damage with non-EM weapons. Using [[Zio. Weapon Casing|Weapon Casings]] looted earlier may be helpful here to avoid losing your only way to fight.
Due to uneven calculations for line-of-sight and weapon range, it is possible to shoot the Golems once before you are spotted at 16 range. See the Golem 1/2 spots below for reference. This allows Cogmind to wait 2 turns before shooting to avoid any movement accuracy penalties, since every time counts particularly hard when fighting a Golem. If using EM traps, short ranged EM weapons, or Impact weapons, see the lure images for reference. This will get Cogmind spotted, likely get shot at for 1 volley, and then draw the Golem in closer. The Exiles item will typically require fighting the top Golem. The bottom one tends to be totally optional.
[[Gallery]]ZDC Golem Spot 1.png|16-range Golem 1 spot|ZDC Golem Spot 2.png|Golem 2 spot|ZDC Golem Lure 1.png|Golem lure 1|ZDC Golem Lure 2.png|Golem lure 2[[/Gallery]]
[[Heading:2]][[Assembled (4)|Assembled]] Wall[[/Heading]]
[[Image]]ZDC Wall Activation Zone.png|Approximate wall activation zone[[/Image]]
The Assembled wall is an indestructible wall containing 35 Assembled and 2 [[Assembler|Assemblers]] that will automatically open up when Cogmind gets too close to it. See the image on the right for a range reference. This range encompasses the GOLEM Unit containers, so fighting the wall is required to grab them the normal way.
Fighting the wall practically requires Launchers to avoid becoming overwhelmed. Any kinds of launchers work, although explosive launchers are better due to their higher range and base damage. Trying to use launchers at a range where they won't miss and take out the GOLEM unit containers is ideal. Otherwise it can be minorly annoying up to even deadly to have a large number of growing Golems running around. They grow slowly, but trying to deal with the Assembled and growing Golems at the same time can be a recipe for disaster. Alternately, the [[AS-neutralizer No. 17b]] can be used here to almost entirely eliminate any threat of the wall. The Assemblers will still need to be destroyed, but the rest of the Assembled will become useless.
[[Heading:2]]Loot[[/Heading]]
After everything else is cleaned out, all that's left is claiming the loot. Wall Chambers will drop [[GOLEM Unit|GOLEM Units]] when destroyed. They will turn into a Golem almost immediately, so grab them quickly. They can sometimes be turned into their part state upon being destroyed (standard loot rules), so applying positive and negative Salvage does work here. Using melee weapons is recommended to avoid missing into other containers and spawning further Golems.
One alternative method of claiming the GOLEM Units can avoid fighting the wall at all. The idea is to shoot open some of the Golem chambers, purposefully allow them to regrow a leg, let them wander closer to the right side of the map, and then destroy them a +Salvage method to obtain a GOLEM Unit. This method can be a bit risky if the regrowing Golems do not cooperate and will result in damaged GOLEM Units. This approach can be particularly useful if Cogmind is stuck without any Launchers but still wants to play a Golem build.
The Exiles item will normally require fighting both the wall and the top Golem. One alternative is if Zion contained the [[Phasing AFG]]. By using that, the item can be grabbed without any fighting on the left side of the map.
