Small ideas:

Medium ideas:
- Add ignore obsolete parts in search
    - Hard to know what an "obsolete" part is
- Add proper followups for build page

Big ideas:
- Save search/parts in URL
    - Can do for all pages
- Actively save build and update hash when modifying things
    - Easier than other pages since hash is already in existence
