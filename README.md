# About
Cog-Minder is a helper website for [Cogmind](https://www.gridsagegames.com/cogmind/). It is a parts searcher that takes information from the in-game gallery CSV export and turns it into this searchable webpage. It has most items available in Beta 9.6, so any additional exports including Beta 10 or other missing items are much appreciated. Check it out [here](https://noemica.github.io/cog-minder/).

This is an MIT licensed open source project with the source available on GitHub.

Thanks to Valguris, PI-314, GJ, and ZXC from the roguelike discord for donating gallery exports, PlasticHeart for creating the [Cog and Smallcaps](https://github.com/plhx/cogfont) font files, and Kyzrati for making Cogmind.
