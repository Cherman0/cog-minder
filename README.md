# About
Cog-Minder is a helper website for [Cogmind](https://www.gridsagegames.com/cogmind/). It has a [parts searcher](https://noemica.github.io/cog-minder/parts.html) that takes information from the in-game gallery CSV export and turns it into this searchable webpage, a [bots bestiary](https://noemica.github.io/cog-minder/bots.html) that lists all bots in the game and their stats, a [hacking calculator](https://noemica.github.io/cog-minder/hacks.html) that shows hacking success rates, and a [combat simulator](https://noemica.github.io/cog-minder/simulator.html) that predicts combat outcomes from a collection of equipped parts. It should have all items and bots as of Beta 10.2, but let me know if anything seems missing. Check it out [here](https://noemica.github.io/cog-minder/).

This is an MIT licensed open source project with the source available on GitHub.

Thanks to Valguris, PI-314, GJ, ZXC, and MTF from the roguelike discord for donating gallery exports, PlasticHeart for creating the [Cog and Smallcaps](https://github.com/plhx/cogfont) font files, and Kyzrati for making Cogmind.
